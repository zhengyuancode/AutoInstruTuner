The Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems (JINTACCS) Program was established by JCS Memorandum SM-184-78, 7 March 1978, to replace the GAMO Program, although directives that were pertinent to the GAMO Program are considered applicable to the JINTACCS Program.  The JTIDS/MIDS program was established as a Joint Service Program to develop and acquire a secure, jamresistant communications system with inherent capabilities to support information distribution, relative navigation, and identification that would support both intra- and inter-Service information exchange between tactical command and control facilities/systems.  JCS Memorandum SM-362-75, 2 July 1975, stipulates the relationship between the JTIDS/MIDS and GAMO (now the JINTACCS) Programs.  JTIDS/MIDS may provide either primary or alternate transmission means through which appropriate tactical data systems are interconnected.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff had directed the GAMO Executive Agent (EA) (SM-575-77, 27 June 1977) to develop the message standard for the JTIDS/MIDS, which included the development of a JTIDS Technical Interface Concept (JTIC) and a JTIDS Technical Interface Design Plan - Test Edition (JTIDP-TE), as well as the responsibility to plan, schedule, conduct, and evaluate joint testing of the JTIDP in order to validate its compatibility and interoperability for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

DP symbol packets are used for the four TR symbols following the synchronization preamble, header words of all transmissions, all symbols of the RTT Interrogation/Reply message, and all data symbols of the Standard DP and Packed-2 DP message packing structures.  The SP symbol is used for the data symbols of the Packed-2 SP and Packed-4 SP message packing structures. The JU may be initialized to transmit only DP message packing structures for any participation group.

CPSM, also known as minimum frequency shift keying, can be viewed as phase coherent Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation.  Viewed as an FSK modulation, CPSM is represented by a phase coherent binary FSK signal between two frequencies, $\\mathbb{F}_{1}$ and $\\operatorname{F}_{2}$ , with separation between them equal to 1/2T, where $\\mathrm{~T~}=$ the digit duration of 200 nanoseconds, as illustrated in Figure 3.3-6.

Operational procedures will ensure that TNs are normally allocated in blocks which are entirely numeric or entirely alphanumeric, not a mixture.  Operational procedures will further ensure that addresses are allocated from within a block or blocks which are not allocated for use as surveillance TNs to insure against the duplicate TN situation which could occur if an address is the same as a TN within an allocated block of surveillance TNs.  No specific block(s) of TNs is reserved for this purpose, although testing or operational experience may dictate the need to do so.  In an interface with Link 11 and/or 11B units, the block of TNs allocated as JU addresses should be below the octal number 07777 to ensure that a JU has one and only one TN throughout a Link 11/11B/16 interface.
