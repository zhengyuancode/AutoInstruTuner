1. SCOPE
    1.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of MIL-STD-6016 is to describe the approved standards to achieve
compatibility and interoperability between command and control and
communications systems and equipment of U.S. military forces employed or
intended to be employed in joint tactical operations. This publication is to
be complemented by CJCSM 6120.01, Joint Multi-Tactical Data Link (TDL)
Operating Procedures (JMTOP), which will provide for planning and common
procedures to be used by forces in the joint tactical environment using Link
16 as the basis for information exchange.

    1.2 DOCUMENT STRUCTURE
MIL-STD-6016 consists of six sections and five appendices. Section 1
provides the introduction and scope. Section 2 provides the applicable
documents required to operate on Link 16. Section 3 contains a glossary of
terms and definitions and a summary description of The Joint Tactical
Information Distribution System (JTIDS). Certain terms concerning
interoperability, compatibility, and commonality are included, as well as
other terms that have discrete meaning within the framework of MIL-STD-6016. 
Section 4 contains the general requirements, conventions, and protocols for
information exchange and forwarding on Link 16. Section 5 contains the
detailed requirements for the Link 16 fixed format message construction and
the J-Series word descriptions. Shown for each Link 16 message is the
message designator, purpose, format, transmit/receive rules, word map, word
description and field coding. The specific J-Series word descriptions are
contained in three parts separated from the main volume of MIL-STD 6016; Part
1 contains the detailed descriptions for Link 16 words J0 through J6; Part 2
contains the detailed descriptions for Link 16 words J7 through J12; Part 3
contains the detailed descriptions for Link 16 words J12 through the RTT
words. Section 6 contains notes of a general nature that apply to the use of
this document.
Appendix A identifies the minimum implementation requirements that must be
met by all Service/Agency (S/A) systems participating on the Link 16
Interface. Satisfaction of these joint data exchange requirements is
mandatory to establish and maintain the Link 16 Interface, to participate
within a specific technical function, and to prevent adverse effects on the
interface. Minimum implementation requirements must be satisfied at each of
seven different levels: functional, related function, message, related
message, word, data element, and data item. These requirements are defined
in terms of transmission and reception for both Command and Control JTIDS
Units (C[2] JUs) and nonC[2] JUs.
Appendix B contains a dictionary of the data elements used in Link 16. The
data elements are uniquely specified by two numbers, the Data Field
Identifier (DFI) and its Data Use Identifier (DUI). The DFI includes a
single concept and is the generic representation of the DUIs grouped under
it. The DUIs, which are representative of the DFI concept, contain the Data

```

-----

```
Items (DIs) used to compose the data element. Alphabetical and numerical
indexes of the DFIs and DUIs are included in Appendix B Sections 1 and 2; the
DFIs are listed in numerical sequence in Section 3.
Appendix C contains the data forwarding rules, protocols, and translations
required between J series and M series messages. Data forwarding is the
process of receiving data on one digital data link and outputting the data in
the proper format and protocol of another digital data link. In the process,
a message(s) received on one link is translated to an appropriate message(s)
on another link. All systems that forward data must adhere to Appendix C. 
In the course of implementing Link 16, it is recognized that some systems may
use internal system translations (e.g., Link 16 to Link 11B) and some systems
may transmit originated track data on more than one data link at the same
time. Functionally, such systems are not data forwarders; however, they will
adhere to the guidance in Appendix C to ensure that the closest possible
relationship of data elements and data element interpretation will be
maintained among all users of the data.
Appendix D, and the information for the Classified Supplements located in the
TDL Development System (TDS), describes the Link 16 implementation by each
service/agency participating in the Link 16 joint interface. It shows the
implementation from the functional level down to the data item level for each
system.
Appendix E is the repository for Interface Change Proposals (ICPs) written
against MIL-STD-6016. This appendix is maintained separately by the Defense
Information System Agency (DISA/IN5). A complete listing of all TDL ICPs and
their current status is contained in the DISA TDL ICP Status Report, which is
updated after each CCB meeting.

    1.3 BACKGROUND
JCS Memorandum SM-205-71, 1 April 1971, established a program to ensure the
joint interoperability of tactical command and control systems in support of
the Ground and Amphibious Military Operations (GAMO) Program. The Joint
Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems (JINTACCS) Program
was established by JCS Memorandum SM-184-78, 7 March 1978, to replace the
GAMO Program, although directives that were pertinent to the GAMO Program are
considered applicable to the JINTACCS Program. The JTIDS/MIDS program was
established as a Joint Service Program to develop and acquire a secure, jamresistant communications system with inherent capabilities to support
information distribution, relative navigation, and identification that would
support both intra- and inter-Service information exchange between tactical
command and control facilities/systems. JCS Memorandum SM-362-75, 2 July
1975, stipulates the relationship between the JTIDS/MIDS and GAMO (now the
JINTACCS) Programs. JTIDS/MIDS may provide either primary or alternate
transmission means through which appropriate tactical data systems are
interconnected. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had directed the GAMO Executive
Agent (EA) (SM-575-77, 27 June 1977) to develop the message standard for the
JTIDS/MIDS, which included the development of a JTIDS Technical Interface
Concept (JTIC) and a JTIDS Technical Interface Design Plan - Test Edition
(JTIDP-TE), as well as the responsibility to plan, schedule, conduct, and
evaluate joint testing of the JTIDP in order to validate its compatibility
and interoperability for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Services determined that the requirement
for the JINTACCS Program would be extended beyond FY 1985, the year the
program originally was to be completed. JCS Memorandum SM-750-82, 6 December
1982, was issued to ensure that the program responsibilities would be
accomplished. SM-750-82 tasked the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army as the EA
responsible for managing the development and the testing of joint message
standards for the JTIDS/MIDS. In addition, this memorandum expanded the
previous tasking by including a requirement to develop the Link 16 Interface
Management Plan to show phased implementation of the Link 16 Interface for
systems/platforms that are specified by the Services in the JTIC.
On 5 July 1984, the Deputy Secretary of Defense signed DOD Directive 5154.28,
which established the Joint Tactical Command, Control and Communications

```

```
Agency (JTC3A) under the Defense Communication Agency (DCA), and assigned to
it responsibility for the development and maintenance of a joint
architecture, interface standards, and interface definitions for
tactical/mobile C[3] systems. All program activities and resources of the Joint
Tactical Communication Office and the JINTACCS Program were transferred to
the JTC3A. JTC3A on 1 February 1992 was changed to the Joint Information
Engineering Organization (JIEO) in the Defense Information System Agency
(DISA), formerly DCA.
The Joint Multi-TADIL Standards Working Group (JMSWG), chaired by JIEO,
directed on 10 May 1996, that the JTIDP-TE, a test document, be superseded by
MIL-STD-6016, Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL) J Message Standard,
in order to establish an approved operational baseline.

    1.4 POLICY
Applicable statements of policy are contained in DOD directives and
correspondence. Essentially, interoperability, compatibility, and
commonality in the degree necessary to provide for flexible, effective, and
economical operation of tactical forces will be achieved. Commonality,
compatibility, and interoperability are objectives. Interoperability in
joint tactical operations is absolutely essential for operational
effectiveness.

    1.5 CONCEPT
MIL-STD-6016 complies with basic DOD policies and has been developed in
consonance with the following concepts:
    a. Tactical command and control, and communications systems standards
are developed only for systems and equipment applicable to functional areas
in which the need for interoperability and compatibility has been validated
as essential by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
    b. These standards apply to operational and future tactical systems
and use system characteristics previously approved for Service use where such
characteristics meet the joint requirements.
    c. This document establishes certain standards and criteria for
message formats and transmission characteristics that will be used in the
design and/or procurement of systems and equipment. Additionally, these
standards will be used in computer program development and when new system
designs are implemented within existing systems.
    d. An interface between tactical systems should exploit the maximum
capability of sensors and processors to provide precise information exchange
in support of tactical operations.
    e. Message format standards and information exchange criteria in those
standards are designed to support established doctrine and known
requirements. They will be responsive to revision, as indicated.

    1.6 DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS
MIL-STD-6016 was developed based on information produced by and coordinated
with the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, the
National Security Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, as documented
in the JTIC dated April 1982 (amended and approved by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff (JCS) on 5 May 1983). Additionally, coordination was accomplished with
international standards under guidance of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
    a. Within the Joint Staff, standardization is accomplished by the 
Director for Command, Control and Communications Systems, J-6. Through the
Director, J-6, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA/IN5) develops
standards and criteria, as necessary.
    b. During the development of tactical standards, it is necessary to
consider the relationship to other national standards and international
standards. DISA/IN5 develops these standards in consultation with other
activities of the Department of Defense, including DISA, DIA, and NSA/CSS, to
ensure compatibility between U.S. tactical and strategic systems and
equipment. Formal coordination is obtained, where necessary, through actions
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. International applications are considered
during the development and revision of standards through consultation with
various national and international agencies. NATO STANAG 5516 and STANAG
5616 reflects these standards for Link 16.

    1.7 APPLICATION OF STANDARDS
MIL-STD-6016 is used by the Services, commands, and applicable DOD Agencies
in developing and acquiring new systems, computer programs, and equipment as
required, for updating existing systems for use on the Link 16 Interface. 
The application of the minimum requirements for information exchange on Link
16 is provided in the following paragraphs:
    a. Application of Minimum Requirements: The mandatory minimum
requirements, Appendix A, apply to all systems, existing and future, that
elect to exchange information via Link 16. The applicability of these
requirements is directed toward digital data exchange in a joint environment
where systems of two or more Services/DOD Agencies are involved. These
requirements should be used as guidelines for internal service or system data
links when no external interface exists.
    b. Exceptions to Minimum Requirements: Exceptions to the minimum
requirements for information exchange will be considered and approved or
denied on a case by case basis by DISA/IN5.
Requests for exceptions will be submitted by the individual Service/DOD
Agency to DISA/IN5 for approval or resolution. Action on the request will be
in accordance with CJCSI 6610.01, TADIL Standardization Policy and Procedures
and with JIEO Plan 3200, Department of Defense Information Technology (IT)
Standards Management Plan. The request will identify the specific tactical
data system, the items for which the exception is requested, and the reason
for requesting the exception.
The channel for submission of requests for exceptions is the same as that for
submitting recommended changes to these standards.

Concurrent Operations The process of communicating on
                         two, or more, digital data links at
                         the same time, as a participant.
                         The concurrent operating unit
                         exchanges with these links all
                         information held in its local data
                         base, but remote information is not
                         forwarded. Protocols of each link
                         are adhered to by the concurrent
                         operating unit. The local data
                         base of a concurrent operating unit
                         is the normal assimilation of data
                         by that unit and includes local
                         sensor data, local operator inputs,
                         and data received and accepted into
                         the local database from a data
                         link, e.g., ID or IFF/SIF data.
Contention Access Mode A transmit access mode in which a
                         given time slot block is assigned
                         to more than one JU. Each JU will
                         transmit at a specified rate in the
                         time slot block by selecting time
                         slots for transmission
                         pseudorandomly.
Control The near real-time direction of
                         weapons systems and supporting
                         platforms for the accomplishment of
                         assigned missions.
Correlation The determination that a system
                         track or local sensor track data
                         report represents the same object
                         or point as another track and/or
                         the process of combining two such
                         tracks/data under one track number.
Data Element A basic unit (class) of information
                         having a unique meaning and
                         subcategories (data items) of
                         distinct units or values. Examples
                         of data elements are military
                         personnel grade, sex, race,
                         geographic location, and military
                         unit. (Joint Pub 1-02) The Link
                         16 data element is the Data Use
                         Identifier (DUI).
Data Field Identifier (DFI) (JTIDS/MIDS) A category of data whose
                         specification includes one or more
                         Data Use Identifier (DUI)
                         specifications. Each DUI's class
                         of data must fall within the bounds
                         of the DFI category.

Data Forwarding The process of receiving data on
                         one digital data link and
                         outputting the data, using proper
                         format and link protocols, to
                         another type of digital data
                         link(s). In the process, a
                         message(s) received on one link is
                         translated to an appropriate
                         message(s) on another link. Data
                         forwarding is accomplished by the
                         selected forwarding units(s)
                         simultaneously participating on
                         more than one type of data link.
                         The data that is forwarded is based
                         on the data received and is not
                         dependent upon the local system
                         data of the data forwarding unit or
                         its implementation of the received
                         message or the forwarded message.
Data Item (JTIDS/MIDS) A subunit of descriptive
                         information or value classified
                         under a data element. For example,
                         the data element "military
                         personnel grade" contains data
                         items such as sergeant, captain,
                         and colonel. (Joint Pub 1-02).
Data Link The means of connecting one
                         location to another for the purpose
                         of transmitting and receiving data.
                         (Joint Pub 1-02)
Data Mile (DM) A standard unit of distance - 6000
                         feet. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Data Source A unit to which data can be
                         addressed and from which data can
                         be identified as to source, e.g.,
                         all IUs. (MIL-STD-6011)
Data Symbol A general term for representing
                         both information symbols and parity
                         symbols in aggregate. (System
                         Segment Specification for JTIDS/
                         MIDS Class 2 Terminal)
Data Use Identifier (DUI) (JTIDS/MIDS) A JTIDS/MIDS data element (class of
                         data). The DUI specification
                         determines the name and permitted
                         contents of each message field to
                         which the DUI is assigned, as
                         explained below.

                         A Data Field Identifier (DFI)
                         specification includes a
                         specification for each DUI under
                         that DFI. Each DUI specification
                         identifies the DUI name, and the
                         data items and associated bit codes
                         employed by the DUI. When a DUI is
                         designated as the contents of a
                         JTIDS message field, the DUI name
                         is the field name, and the data
                         items employed by the DUI are
                         (subject to any implementation or
                         message restrictions) the data
                         items which may be conveyed in that
                         field.

Round-Trip-Timing (RTT) The process used by a JTIDS/MIDS
                         terminal to directly determine the
                         offset between its clock and that
                         of another JTIDS/MIDS terminal.
                         This is used to achieve and
                         maintain fine synchronization and
                         to improve the terminal's time
                         quality. This process involves

    3.3 JTIDS/MIDS TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS
JTIDS/MIDS is a high-capacity, digital information distribution system
providing integrated communications, navigation and identification
capabilities. It provides secure, flexible, and jam-resistant information
transfer in real time among the dispersed and mobile units characteristic of
modern armed forces. JTIDS/MIDS combines characteristics designed to
overcome many of the limitations common to existing systems by providing for
increased system capacity and coverage, improved connectivity, survivability,
jamming resistance, and reduced danger of data loss and data obsolescence.
The following discussion focuses on the JTIDS/MIDS Time Division Multiple
Access (TDMA) architecture (nets and time slots) and the basic features of
the JTIDS/MIDS TDMA communication network, including network protocol,
transmission procedures, participation groups and messages.
    3.3.1 JTIDS/MIDS TDMA ARCHITECTURE
The TDMA architecture's basic element is a single communication circuit or
net that is shared by many users. The net is subdivided into time slots that
can be assigned to individual JTIDS/MIDS participants (called JTIDS Units
(JUs))for transmitting messages. Capacity can be expanded further by
simultaneous operation on several nets. In general, a JU operates only on a
single net at a time but it can switch nets on a time-slot-by-time-slot
basis.
All JUs are required to operate in the TDMA network and to process the
"Standard Double Pulse (DP)", "Packed-2 Single Pulse (SP)", "Packed-2 DP",
"Packed-4 SP" and "Round-Trip-Timing (RTT)" message packing structures (see
paragraph 3.3.9).
Any JU can transmit Standard DP, Packed-2 SP, Packed-2 DP, Packed-4 SP or RTT
message packages in each time slot. The distinction between the five packing
structures lies in the number of pulses transmitted, whether one or two
pulses represents a data symbol and, consequently, how much data are
transmitted in a time slot. JUs can transmit messages in an error correction
codeword format in which error correction coding is used by receivers to
correct errors caused by noise or jamming. All data in correctable codewords

```

-----

```
are error free. All data in uncorrectable codewords are rejected. Link 16
information is transmitted error correction coded. Messages also may be
transmitted in a non-error coded message packing structure.
A JU can transmit or receive one Standard DP, Packed-2 SP, Packed-2 DP, or
Packed-4 SP message packing structure in a time slot. A JU can alternatively
transmit one RTT interrogation message in a time slot and then receive an RTT
reply to that message in the same time slot. If a JU receives an RTT
interrogation message for which it is a valid responder, it will then
transmit an RTT reply message in the same time slot. A JU can switch between
transmit and receive modes on a time-slot-by-time-slot basis in accordance
with its time slot assignments.
    3.3.1.1 SINGLE-NET ARCHITECTURE
Figure 3.3-1 illustrates the single-net architecture. System operation
divides time into 12.8-minute intervals, called epochs, with 112.5 epochs per
24-hour day. Each epoch is further divided into 7.8125-millisecond
intervals, referred to as time slots (or slots) so that there are 98,304
slots per epoch. The time slots are organized into three sets (A, B, and C)
of 32,768 slots per set. The slots in each set are numbered from 0 to 32,767
so that each slot is identified by its slot number and set, e.g., OA. The
slots are distributed in time within each epoch so that time slot "n" of Set
A follows time slot "n-1" of Set C and precedes time slot "n" of Set B, where
"n" is the set of integers in the sequence 0 to 32,767.
    3.3.1.2 MULTINET ARCHITECTURE
JTIDS/MIDS system capacity can be expanded by simultaneous operation on
several nets. Multiple-net operation (see paragraph 3.3.6) is accomplished
by assigning independent frequency-hopping patterns for each net to the
pulses used to convey Link 16 information. A JU can operate on only one net
in a single time slot, but it can switch nets on a time-slot-by-time-slot
basis.

    3.3.2 JTIDS TDMA COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
Functionally, the TDMA architecture is configured to provide a communication
structure or network composed of multiple participation groups for network
maintenance and information exchange. Appropriate protocols are provided for
establishment and maintenance of the network and the protocols for control of
information exchange on the network.
    3.3.2.1 SYSTEM TIMING AND SYNCHRONIZATION
To maintain the TDMA discipline, JUs must be synchronized with a common
network time. Network time is that time maintained by a particular JU
designated as the Network Time Reference (NTR) and is the common time
reference with which all other JUs synchronize. Synchronization consists of
making corrections to the clock maintained in each JU and is performed in
four steps; (1) initial net entry, (2) coarse synchronization, (3) fine
synchronization, and (4) synchronization maintenance. These steps are
performed automatically and depend only on the exchange of messages directly
with the NTR or with other JUs that have synchronized with network time.
Any JU is capable of operating as the NTR. When designated as the NTR, a JU
assumes its clock is correct and does not adjust its clock based on network
operation (i.e., fine synchronization). There are provisions for an
operator-initiated adjustment to system time by the NTR. Such an adjustment
is a coordinated operation that involves the simultaneous adjustment of the
clocks in the NTR and all other JUs. When a JU is not operating as the NTR,
it is designated as a primary or secondary user. Primary users use the
active mode and secondary users use the passive mode for achieving fine
synchronization. A secondary user may use the active mode for achieving fine
synchronization under certain circumstances. The steps involved in
synchronization are discussed below.
    3.3.2.2 NET ENTRY
To achieve initial net entry, a JU searches for and receives a valid net
entry message. In communication modes 1 and 2, the terminal searches for a
net entry message during a time interval that is determined by its amount of
uncertainty of the estimate of system time. If the terminal fails to receive

```

-----

```
a valid net entry message during that interval, it repeats the process,
expanding the uncertainty window by a predetermined method. In communication
mode 4, net entry is completed upon the reception of any valid JTIDS/MIDS
message.
    3.3.2.3 COARSE SYNCHRONIZATION
To achieve coarse synchronization, a JU must adjust its clock so that it can
identify time slots (set and number) and identify the start of time slots
with sufficient accuracy to receive any message and perform the active mode
of fine synchronization. Except for RTT Interrogation messages, a JU is not
permitted to transmit until it has achieved fine synchronization. Coarse
synchronization is performed by receiving an error-free Initial Entry message
and using the time of arrival of the Initial Entry message to adjust the JU's
clock. When operating in communication mode 4 (refer to paragraph 3.3.6),
the Initial Entry message includes information identifying the time slot in
which it was transmitted. When operating in communication mode 1 or 2, a JU
is able only to decrypt the Initial Entry message received in a predefined
time slot. When operating in communication modes 1 or 2, a JU must be
initialized with the following parameters:
    a. Code of the day.
    b. Estimate of system time and an indication of the uncertainty in the
estimate of time.
    c. Source track number.
    3.3.2.4 FINE SYNCHRONIZATION
Upon achieving coarse synchronization, a JU automatically begins the fine
synchronization process, either actively or passively. This process is
completed when a JU can predict system time with a specified accuracy. Upon
achieving fine synchronization, a JU begins receiving and transmitting
messages subject only to the constraints imposed by its assigned transmit
mode and participation groups. The active and passive modes for achieving
fine synchronization are discussed below.

```

-----

```
    3.3.2.4.1 ACTIVE MODE
The active mode uses RTT based on the RTT Interrogation and Reply messages
(discussed in paragraph 3.3.10). Figure 3.3-2 illustrates the RTT process. 
The interrogating JU transmits an RTT Interrogation message and determines
the associated RTT Reply message's Time Of Arrival (TOAR). The interrogating
JU then computes its clock correction based on the measured value of TOAR and
the value of TOAI included in the RTT Reply message. This process is
independent of the JTIDS/MIDS relative navigation function since own-position
data are not required.

```

-----

```
            FIGURE 3.3-2. General RTT Algorithm
The RTT Interrogation message may be addressed to a specific JU (RTT-A
Interrogation message) or unaddressed (RTT-B Interrogation message). In the
latter case, a JU determines from received position reports that other units
exist with time quality exceeding own-unit time quality. An interrogation
message is transmitted on the net whose net number is equal to the highest
time quality contained in any received position report. JUs with a time
quality equal to the time quality specified in the RTT Interrogation message
respond with an RTT Reply message on the net number equal to the time
quality.

```

-----

```
    3.3.2.4.2 PASSIVE MODE
In the passive mode a JU simultaneously adjusts its clock and its estimate of
own position (see paragraph 3.3.8) until it determines that its clock is
operating within the required tolerance. The JU measures the Time Of Arrival
(TOA) of error-free PPLI messages from selected JUs and combines multiple TOA
measurements through a recursive filter process to determine corrections for
its clock and adjustment to its own-position estimate. An estimate of own
position and an estimate of position quality are required for the passive
mode. A JU selects the JUs to be used in the passive mode on the basis of
the time and position quality values in received PPLI messages.
    3.3.2.4.3 SYNCHRONIZATION MAINTENANCE
After achieving fine synchronization JUs continue to monitor clock
performance through the outputs of the filter process and perform the fine
synchronization process (active or passive) as necessary to maintain
synchronization with system time. If clock errors exceed predefined limits,
a JU inhibits message transmission (except RTT Interrogation messages) and
initiates the fine synchronization process.
    3.3.3 TRANSMISSION PROCEDURES
The following paragraphs discuss the format of JTIDS/MIDS transmissions and
the steps involved in preparing messages for transmission.
    3.3.3.1 TRANSMISSION STRUCTURE
Figure 3.3-3 illustrates the basic JTIDS/MIDS transmission structure for RTT
messages and data messages. The structure consists of the following parts:
    a. Jitter. A variable time delay in the start of transmission in a
time slot. Jitter is not employed when operating in communication mode 4;
when RTT messages are transmitted or when transmitting messages in the
Packed-2 DP or Packed-4 message packing structures (see paragraph 3.3.9.1).
    b. Synchronization. A pattern of 16 DP symbol packets that allows
receiving JUs to synchronize to the transmission. The pattern is changed

```

-----

```
from time slot to time slot, and within a time slot the pattern is different
among nets.
    c. Time Refinement (TR). A fixed pattern of four DP symbol packets
used for TR.
    d. Header (HDR). A header word (see paragraph 3.3.9.3) that provides
information concerning the message(s) transmitted in a time slot.
    e. Data. Message(s) transmitted in the time slot (see paragraph
3.3.9).
    f. Propagation/Guard. A time period that allows for the propagation
of the signal to the maximum range and time for JUs to prepare for
transmissions in the next time slot. The propagation/guard time is
selectable for a maximum range of 300 nautical miles (normal) or 500 nautical
miles (extended).
    3.3.3.2 TRANSMISSION SIGNAL GENERATION
The steps involved in preparing a message for transmission are illustrated in
Figure 3.3-3 and discussed in the following paragraphs.

    3.3.3.2.1 ERROR DETECTION ENCODING
For fixed and variable format messages, prior to Reed-Solomon encoding,
twelve error detection parity bits are to be generated for each block of 210
data bits. This is done by using a (237, 225) polynomial code having the
generating polynomial G(X) = 1 + X[12] where the "+" indicates module-2 addition
over each block of 225 bits. The 225 bits include the 15 bits constituting
the Track Number, Source field in the header word and the 210 data bits. The
12 parity bits are divided into three groups of four bits and a zero bit is
added to the beginning of each four bits to fill the parity byte. The bytes
are then combined with 70 data bits to create 75-bit words. The parity byte
appears in bit positions 70 through 74 of each word.

    3.3.3.2.2 ENCRYPTION
In communication modes 1 and 2 baseband data and cyclic code shift keying
(CCSK) codewords are encrypted.
    3.3.3.2.3 FORWARD ERROR CORRECTION ENCODING
The header word, fixed and variable format messages, and selected free-text
messages are encoded using a Reed-Solomon code. The Reed-Solomon code is a
32-ary cyclic block code in the class of generalized Bose-ChaudhuriHocquenguem (BCH) codes. The Reed-Solomon encoding process converts the 35bit header word into a (16, 7) Reed-Solomon codeword. The (16, 7) codeword
contains 16 five-bit bytes, of which seven bytes contain data (35 bits of
header) and nine bytes contain parity bits. The 75-bit words comprising
messages are individually encoded as (31, 15) Reed-Solomon codewords. The
(31, 15) codeword contains 31 five-bit bytes, of which 15 bytes contain data
and 16 bytes contain parity bits. The (31, 15) and (16, 7) codewords can be
encoded and decoded by the same logic.
    3.3.3.2.4 INTERLEAVING
In communication modes 1 and 2, the sequence of five-bit symbols comprising
the Reed-Solomon encoded header word and the five-bit symbols comprising the
data of the Standard DP and Packed-2 SP message packing structure is
transmitted in a predetermined random order. The header symbols are
interleaved among the data symbols. The header and data symbols of the
Packed-2 DP and Packed-4 SP message packing structures are also transmitted
in a predetermined random order. In all four message packing structures, the
header symbols are transmitted in the same pulse position.
    3.3.3.2.5 CYCLIC CODE SHIFT KEYING ENCODING
CCSK encoding is applied to the five-bit bytes comprising the Reed-Solomon
encoded header word and message(s) after the bytes have been interleaved (if
required). Table 3.3-1 illustrates the relationship between the five-bit
bytes and the CCSK codewords. The 32-bit CCSK codeword for a byte is
generated by left-cyclic shifting the initial CCSK codeword (So) n times,
where n equals the value (0-31) of the byte being encoded.

    3.3.3.2.6 TRANSMISSION SYMBOL PACKET GENERATION
The CCSK codewords are converted to one of two types (DP or SP) of
transmission symbol packets (also called symbol packets) illustrated in
Figure 3.3-5. In the DP symbol packet the same CCSK codeword is applied to
both pulses. For communication modes 1 and 2, each pulse of every symbol is
transmission encrypted: the 32-bit CCSK sequence is modified in a way known
by all receivers enabling them to recover the CCSK sequence and; therefore,
the five data bits it represents. There is no symbol packet encryption for
mode 4. DP symbol packets are used for the four TR symbols following the
synchronization preamble, header words of all transmissions, all symbols of
the RTT Interrogation/Reply message, and all data symbols of the Standard DP
and Packed-2 DP message packing structures. The SP symbol is used for the
data symbols of the Packed-2 SP and Packed-4 SP message packing structures. 
The JU may be initialized to transmit only DP message packing structures for
any participation group. The header word indicates the type of message
packing structure; therefore, the receiving JU can receive any message
without prior knowledge of the message packing structure transmitted.

Each transmitted pulse consists of a burst of carrier frequency. The
frequency is hopped from pulse to pulse in communication mode 1 only. The
transmitted pulse is formed by continuous phase shift modulation (CPSM) of
the carrier frequency at a 5-megabit-per-second rate using the 32-bit pulse
sequence as the modulating signal. CPSM, also known as minimum frequency
shift keying, can be viewed as phase coherent Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
modulation. Viewed as an FSK modulation, CPSM is represented by a phase
coherent binary FSK signal between two frequencies, F1 and F2, with separation
between them equal to 1/2T, where T = the digit duration of 200 nanoseconds,
as illustrated in Figure 3.3-6. The nth digit is transmitted as the lower
frequency if it is the same as the (n-1)st digit. The higher frequency is
transmitted if it differs. Since noncoherent detection must be employed in
the receiver, the frequency transmitted for the first digit of any pulse is
arbitrary.
    3.3.3.2.7 CARRIER FREQUENCY SELECTION
JTIDS/MIDS transmissions occur in the frequency band between 960 and 1,215
MHZ. In communication modes 2 and 4, all transmissions are made at 969 MHZ. 
In communication mode 1, spread spectrum modulation is employed to spread the
JTIDS/MIDS energy across the band in the 51 discrete frequencies shown in
Table 3.3-2. To prevent interference with the IFF system that also occupies
the frequency band, frequencies are excluded in guard regions around the IFF
frequencies at 1030 and 1090 MHZ. The TACAN system also occupies this band,
and interference with it is prevented by the spread spectrum modulation that
produces JTIDS/MIDS transmissions having low duty cycle and different pulse
spacing with respect to any particular TACAN channel.
    3.3.4 PARTICIPATION GROUPS
Messages are sorted into participation groups (PGs)[*] and are transmitted in
time slots assigned to the PG into which the message has been sorted. The
following paragraphs discuss PG types, time slot and net assignments, and
message exchange and PG protocols.
* Each PG may be thought of as a discrete digital communication channel
operating independently from other PGs, except that the PGs do not have
independent logic for initializing and maintaining communications.

```
    3.3.4.1 PARTICIPATION GROUP TYPES
The two types of PGs are network and needline. A network PG has a function
name (e.g., RTT, PPLI, Surveillance) and is defined by a list of Link 16
labels and sublabels, as specified in the JTIDS TIDP. A message designated
for transmission in a network PG is sorted by its label and sublabel into the
applicable PG and transmitted in a time slot assigned to that PG. Each
needline PG is defined by a list of subscriber addresses. A message
designated for transmission in a needline PG is assigned a destination
address and sorted by its address into the applicable PG. It is transmitted
in a time slot assigned to that PG.
Table 3.3-3 lists some of the defined JTIDS/MIDS network PGs and identifies
their purposes and the messages that can be exchanged on them. As a minimum,
a JTIDS/MIDS communications network must include the PGs identified in Table
3.3-3 (marked by *), and all JUs in an active status must participate on
these PGs.
    3.3.4.2 TIME SLOT AND NET ASSIGNMENTS
The capacity of a JTIDS/MIDS PG is determined by the number of time slots
assigned to the PG. The time slots are assigned in blocks where each block
is defined by the set and slot number of the first time slot in the block and
a Recurrence Rate Number (RRN), where 2[RRN] is the total number of time slots
per epoch in the block assignment (see Table 3.3-4). The time slots in a
block are equally spaced in time throughout an epoch. The net number for a
PG may be predefined or selected during operation. In the latter case, the
network will include multiple PGs of the same type (e.g., voice) operating in
parallel.

    3.3.4.3 MESSAGE EXCHANGE PROTOCOL
The message exchange protocol defines the conditions under which each Link 16
message will be exchanged and the procedures for exchanging each message. 
Some of the areas addressed in the message exchange protocol are:
    a. Transmit/Receive Rules. Defines specific conditions under which a
message and the individual words comprising the message are transmitted. 
Also defines the special rules governing the receipt of the message.
    b. Message Exchange Procedures. Defines how information is exchanged
and managed using the Link 16 messages. For discussion purposes (see Section
4) the message exchange procedures are grouped into technical functions,
e.g., Air Surveillance.
    c. Minimum Implementation. Defines the minimum amount of information
that must be exchanged by a JU to interoperate using Link 16. Minimum
implementation is defined at the network, functional, message, word, data
element and data item levels (see Appendix A).
    3.3.4.4 PARTICIPATION GROUP PROTOCOL
The PG protocol defines the rules and procedures for exchanging any message
on a PG. The PG protocol includes the time slot assignment methods, access
mode, and relay mode (if required).
    3.3.4.4.1 TIME SLOT ASSIGNMENT METHODS
The nets and time slots are assigned to PGs by one or both of the following
time slot assignment methods. The parameters involved in a time slot block
assignment are listed in Table 3.3-5.
    a. In the static time slot assignment method, PG nets and time slot
blocks are assigned during JU initialization or by operator action during
operation. Other communications media (e.g., voice) must be used for
operator coordination in this assignment method.

```

-----

```
    b. In the dynamic time slot assignment method, PG nets and time slot
blocks are assigned dynamically via the network management messages. One or
more JUs are designated to manage the capacity of JTIDS/MIDS PGs. The
designated JUs allocate/reallocate time slots between the PGs for which they
are responsible in response to changing communication needs or requests from
PG participants.
        TABLE 3.3-5. Time Slot Block Assignment Parameters
 1. PG designation.
 2. Access mode assigned to time slot block.
 3. Indication that JU is to add or delete the specified time slot
     block.
 4. Time slot block designation; initial time slot number (0-32,767),
     time slot set (A, B, or C), and recurrence rate number (see
     Table 3.3-4).
 5. Time to execute assignment (epoch, time slot number) (for dynamic
     time slot assignment method only).
 6. Indication that JU is to use the specified time slot block for
     message reception or transmission.
 7. Net number (0-127) if prespecified.
 8. Access rate (for contention access mode only).
 9. Reallocation Pool Number (for time slot reallocation access mode
     only).
 10. KGV-8/TSEC Secure Data Unit (SDU) cryptovariables.
    3.3.4.4.2 ACCESS MODES
The access modes define how time slots assigned to a JU for transmission of
messages of a PG are selected. One or more of the following modes is used
for each JTIDS/MIDS PG:
    a. Dedicated Access Mode. In this mode, time slots assigned for
transmission of a PG's messages are used as needed in order of their
occurrence.

```

-----

```
    b. Contention Access Mode. In this mode, time slots are assigned to
multiple JUs for transmission. A contention access rate is assigned to
define intervals of time having the same rate. Once each interval, each
terminal transmits in one time slot. The time slot used is selected randomly
from all assigned slots that occur during the interval. The contention
access mode can be used only when communication mode 1 is selected.
    c. Time Slot Reallocation Access Mode. In this mode, JUs in a PGC
periodically reallocate a shared pool of time slots such that a JU assigns
itself time slots according to its demand and the announced demands of other
JUs. If the aggregate JU demand for time slots exceeds the capacity of the
pool, the JUs assign themselves slots in proportion to their demands but
scaled down by a common factor such that the total allocation is within the
pool capacity. The mode can be used only when Communication Mode 1 is
selected.
    d. Call-Up Access Mode. In this mode, time slots are allocated
dynamically to JUs for transmission. The PG participants are interrogated
sequentially under centralized control (roll call mode) or decentralized
control (round robin mode). Upon interrogation, a JU transmits all available
messages applicable to the PG, using the next n assigned time slots.
    3.3.5 TRANSMIT MODES
Three operator selectable transmit modes are available to a JU. The selected
transmit mode determines the conditions under which the JU may transmit
messages and is set independently for each JU. The transmit modes are
discussed in the following paragraphs.
    3.3.5.1 NORMAL MODE
In the normal mode, a JU achieves and maintains fine synchronization, either
passively or actively, and then transmits messages unconditionally, subject
only to the constraints of its assigned transmit time slots and message
exchange protocol.

```

-----

```
    3.3.5.2 POLLING MODE
In the polling mode, a JU achieves and maintains fine synchronization either
passively or actively. A JU in the polling mode transmits fixed and variable
format messages only when required to transmit (1) a message in response to a
received Communication Control message addressed to the JU, and (2) an
operator or machine acknowledgment message. JUs do not transmit RTT Reply
messages when in the polling mode. JUs can transmit free text digital voice
and RTT Interrogation messages while in the polling mode.
    3.3.5.3 RADIO SILENCE MODE
In this mode, a JU achieves and maintains fine synchronization using the
passive mode. A JU does not transmit any fixed or variable format messages
in the radio silence mode except when it is initially set to the radio
silence mode. If already in the state of fine synchronization at that time,
a terminal transmits a J2 message to indicate its intent to go Conditional
Radio Silence and that it cannot be used as an active synchronization source. 
A JU can transmit free text digital voice messages while in the radio silence
mode.
    3.3.6 COMMUNICATION MODES
There are three operator selectable communication modes for a JTIDS/MIDS
network. The selected communication mode determines whether or not the
network can operate on multiple nets (by employing frequency hopping) and the
transmitted data are encrypted. All JUs in a JTIDS/MIDS network must select
the same communication mode. In communication modes 2 and 4, all
transmissions are made at 969 MHZ. The communication modes are:
        Communication Mode  Multiple Nets Data Encrypted
            1    Yes    Yes
            2     No    Yes
            3  Mode Not Used Mode Not Used
            4     No    No

```

-----

```
    3.3.7 RELAY FUNCTIONS
JTIDS/MIDS employs radio relay techniques in order to extend communications
coverage beyond line of sight. The relay techniques that are selectable on
an individual PG basis are paired time slot and repromulgation. They are
discussed below.
    3.3.7.1 PAIRED TIME SLOT RELAY
In this technique, paired sets of relay receive and relay transmit time slots
are assigned to a JU. The JU automatically retransmits any valid message(s)
received in a relay receive time slot in the corresponding relay transmit
time slot. Each paired block assigned to a JU is labeled with one of six
relay functions or the PG number of the transmit assignment whose messages it
is relaying. All paired blocks having the same relay function name or PG
number as a label comprise the assignments for that relay function.
    a. Main Net Relay Function. Messages of one or more PGs are relayed
by the main net relay function when paired blocks labeled "Main Net Relay"
have their relay receive blocks corresponding to the transmit blocks of those
PGs. When active as a main net relay, a terminal sets the Active Relay
Indicator, Wide Area Network in its PPLI messages to "active" and transmits
its PPLI messages in both the Common and Special PPLI Pools. A terminal may
operate in either the conditional or unconditional mode for this type of
relay function.
    b. Voice Relay Function. Messages of the voice PG are relayed by the
voice relay function when paired blocks labeled "Voice Net Relay" have their
relay receive blocks corresponding to the transmit block(s) of the voice PG
assignments. If the net number of the voice PG assignments and voice relay
assignments is specified as "No Statement," the voice relay net is selected
by the operator for voice channel operation. A terminal in the active state
of the voice relay function sets the Active Relay Indicator, Voice Channel in
its PPLI message to "active." The net number also is reported in the PPLI
message. A terminal may operate in either the conditional or unconditional
mode for this type of relay function.

```

-----

```
    c. Control Relay Function. Messages of the control PG are relayed by
the control relay function when paired blocks labeled "Control Relay" have
their relay blocks corresponding to the transmit blocks of the control PG
assignments. If the net number of the control PG assignments is specified as
"No Statement," the control relay net is selected by the operator for control
channel operation. A terminal in the active state of the voice relay
function sets the Active Relay Indicator, Control Channel in its PPLI message
to "active." A terminal may operate in either the conditional or
unconditional mode for this type of relay function.
    d. Zoom Relay Function. The paired blocks of a zoom relay function
are identical with those of the main net relay function. In the main net
relay function, the relay receive and relay transmit net numbers are
identical. In the zoom relay assignment, the relay transmit net number is
different from the transmit net number assigned the main net relay function. 
A JU may be assigned to operate either as a main net or zoom relay function,
but not both concurrently. A JU performs the zoom relay function in the
unconditional mode.
    e. Directed Relay Function. The JTIDS/MIDS terminal performs a
directed relay function in the unconditional relay mode (see paragraph
3.3.7.3). The "receive" and "transmit" time slots and net numbers are those
paired blocks assigned to the terminal, by initialization host control or
Radio Relay Control message, as directed relay blocks.
The JTIDS/MIDS terminal is capable of accepting and operating at least 16
directed relay assignments, each assignment labeled in the range 0-15.
    f. Participation Group Relay Function. For this relay function, the
paired block assignments are designated to be PG relay functions and are
labeled with the index number of the PG whose message they are relaying.
    3.3.7.2 REPROMULGATION RELAY
In this technique, the JU that originates a message indicates in the
Repromulgation Relay message how many times a message is to be retransmitted. 
Then each JU assigned to relay messages on the subject PG will decrease by
one the number of retransmissions indicated in the relay message and will

```

-----

```
retransmit the message once. The procedure for selecting relay transmit time
slots depends on the access mode employed by the subject PG. The maximum
radius of the communication coverage is the sum of the line of sight ranges
of the JU that originated a message and all JUs (in one direction) that
relayed the message.
    3.3.7.3 RELAY MODES
All paired blocks having the same label (e.g., main net relay, voice, etc.)
respond collectively to a relay control action having that label. A relay
control action may be given a terminal by transmitting the initial word of
the Radio Relay Control message or via initialization entry. One relay
action, Delete, removes the assignments for that function from the memory of
the terminal so that relay of messages in that function is no longer
permitted. Four other nondelete relay control actions can be specified.
    a. Suspend. A relay function of a terminal placed in the suspended
mode has its assignments held in memory by the terminal; relay of messages in
the function is suspended.
    b. Conditional. A relay function of a JU placed in the conditional
mode becomes active when it provides better communication coverage than other
JUs assigned the same relay function. Only the main net, voice and control
relay functions may be placed in the conditional mode.
    c. Unconditional. A relay function of a JU placed in the
unconditional mode relays all valid messages received in assigned relay
receive time slots. In this method the maximum radius of the communication
coverage is the sum of the line of sight ranges of the JU that originated a
message and the JU that relayed the message.
    d. Message Directed. A PG relay function may be assigned Message
Directed 0 or Message Directed 1 action. If the message directed relay bit
in a Variable Message Format (VMF) message is present and is the same as the
assignment, the message is relayed. If not, the message is not relayed. If
the message directed field is not present in a VMF message or the message is
a fixed word format message, the message is relayed unconditionally.

```

```
    3.3.8 RELATIVE NAVIGATION
The synchronous nature of JTIDS/MIDS provides the basis for individual JUs to
determine their location relative to the other JUs. When two or more JUs
have an accurate, independently derived knowledge of their geodetic position,
the relative navigation function provides all JUs with accurate geodetic
position data.
The relative navigation function is based on the multilateration techniques
illustrated in Figure 3.3-7. A JU could determine its position in three
dimensions based on the measured Time of Arrival (TOA) of PPLI messages from
three JUs and the positions of the transmitting JUs (included in the PPLI
messages). However, the accuracy of the multilateration technique is
affected by relative JU clock errors and the fact that the TOA measurements
are not made simultaneously. Therefore, the TOA measurements are combined
through a recursive filter process to determine own unit position, movement,
and clock corrections. For mobile JUs, dead reckoning data are used to
extrapolate position data between filter operations. In addition, the dead
reckoning data are supplied to the filter for optimum mixing with the
movement data derived from successive position estimates. A JU selects the
TOA measurements to be used in the filter process based on the estimated
accuracy (quality) of its own position and time data and that of other JUs as
reported in their PPLI messages.

    3.3.9 DATA MESSAGES
JTIDS/MIDS data messages convey information (i.e., a transfer of bits or
symbols representing data) among the JUs. JTIDS/MIDS data messages convey
Link 16 messages and free text information. Most JTIDS/MIDS messages fall
within this category. Data messages include those being originated at the
transmitting terminal and those being relayed by the transmitting terminal.
In addition to the synchronization preamble and time refinement/pulses, data
messages contain a header plus the information bearing portion of the
message. These data messages are further distinguished by packing structures
and data formats as indicated in Figure 3.3-3. The packing structures define
the amount and symbol redundancy of information that can be conveyed in a
message transmission, while the data formats define the structure or
formatting of the data themselves. The following paragraphs discuss the
packing structures, data formats, and headers of JTIDS/MIDS data messages.
    3.3.9.1 DATA MESSAGE PACKING STRUCTURES FORMATS
Data messages are transmitted in one of four message packing structures: 
Standard DP, Packed-2 SP, Packed-2 DP, and Packed-4 SP. In each of these
formats, the header word (described more fully in paragraph 3.3.9.3) is sent
as a 16-symbol, double pulse per symbol Reed-Solomon codeword. The
distinction between the four structures lies in the number of data symbols
transmitted to convey information and whether the symbols are SP or DP (see
paragraph 3.3.3.2.6). The following paragraphs describe the four message
packing structures in more detail.
    3.3.9.1.1 STANDARD DP MESSAGE PACKING STRUCTURE
The information bearing portion of Standard DP JTIDS/MIDS message packing
structures consists of 93 symbols. These symbols can convey three (31, 15)
Reed-Solomon codewords representing 225 bits of coded information or,
alternatively, 465 bits of uncoded data. Thus, the Standard DP message
packing structure contains 32 pulses in the synchronization preamble, 8
pulses in the TR segment, and 218 pulses corresponding to 109 DP symbols used
to convey the header plus data. The total message transmission time is 3.354
milliseconds, based on 13.0 microseconds separation between successive

```

-----

```
pulses. The Standard message packing structure can be jittered as described
in paragraph 3.3.3.1.
    3.3.9.1.2 PACKED-2 MESSAGE PACKING STRUCTURE
The information bearing portion of Packed-2 message packing structure
consists of 186 SP symbols. These symbols can convey six (31, 15) ReedSolomon codewords representing 450 bits of coded information or,
alternatively, 930 bits of uncoded data. The data portion of the Packed-2 SP
message packing structure again consists of 218 pulses, as with the Standard
DP message packing structure, of which 32 pulses are used to represent the
16-symbol, double pulse per symbol header, and the remaining 186 information
bearing symbols. As with the Standard DP message packing structure, the
Packed-2 SP message packing structure requires 3.354 milliseconds of
transmission time and can be jittered.
    3.3.9.1.3 PACKED-2 DP MESSAGE PACKING STRUCTURE
The information bearing portion of Packed-2 DP JTIDS/MIDS message packing
structures consists of 186 DP symbols. The Packed-2 DP message packing
structure is identical to the Standard DP message packing structure, except
that it contains an extra 93 DP data symbols, which are appended to the
Standard message packing structure. The 186 DP symbols can convey six (31,
15) Reed-Solomon codewords representing 450 bits of coded information or,
alternatively, 930 bits of uncoded data. Since the Packed-2 DP message
packing structure contains 186 more pulses than Standard DP or Packed-2 SP
message packing structures, the TDMA message transmission time is 5.772
milliseconds for the Packed-2 DP message packing structure. Packed-2 DP
message packing structure is not jittered.
    3.3.9.1.4 PACKED-4 SP MESSAGE PACKING STRUCTURE
The information bearing portion of Packed-4 SP JTIDS/MIDS message packing
structure consists of 372 SP symbols. Packed-4 message packing structure is
identical to the Packed-2 SP message packing structure, except that it
contains an extra 186 SP data symbols, which are appended to the Packed-2 SP
message packing structure. The 372 SP symbols can convey twelve (31, 15)
Reed-Solomon codewords representing 900 bits of coded information or,

```

-----

```
alternatively, 1860 bits of uncoded data. As with Packed-2 DP message
packing structures, the Packed-4 SP message packing structure requires 5.772
milliseconds of transmission time and cannot be jittered.
    3.3.9.2 MESSAGE TYPES
JTIDS/MIDS data messages are further characterized by whether the underlying
information transmitted is arranged in a fixed, predefined format (fixed
format); a variable, but predefined format (variable format); or in a
nonpredefined format (free text format). These message types are described
in the following paragraphs.
    3.3.9.2.1 FIXED FORMAT MESSAGES
A fixed format message includes up to three, six, or twelve 75-bit words (70
data bits/word), depending on the packing format and whether the DP or SP
transmission symbol packet is used. The format and sequence of data fields
in each word are predefined (see section 5). A message is composed of an
initial word and may include extension and/or continuation words. The
availability of data and the applicable message exchange protocol define the
combination of extension and/or continuation words included in a message. 
The basic functions of these words are:
    a. Initial Word. The initial word identifies the message and the sum
of the extension and continuation words following the initial word, and it
contains the basic data included in the message.
    b. Extension Words. The extension words contain additional data that
are normally included in the message. Extension words need not be
transmitted in a message, but, if they are transmitted, they must be
transmitted in serial order following the initial word.
    c. Continuation Words. The continuation words contain amplifying
(e.g., optional) data that are included in the message as required by the
message exchange protocol and the availability of information. If extension
words are transmitted, continuation words must be transmitted following all
extension words.

```

-----

```
A JU can transmit one or more Link 16 initial words in a single Standard DP,
Packed-2 SP, Packed-2 DP, and Packed-4 SP message packing structure.
All words comprising a fixed format message must be transmitted in proper
sequence in a single time slot. Multiple fixed format messages may be
transmitted in a time slot.
    3.3.9.2.2 VARIABLE MESSAGE FORMAT
A VMF consists of a variable length string of fields formatted into 75-bit
words (70 data bits/word) for transmission. The content of individual words
in a message may vary since fields can be repeated and those fields not
required for a message are not transmitted. Several time slots may be
required to transmit a variable message. The VMF includes word and field
accountability data interspersed between or among the data fields. The order
of fields in a VMF may be predefined, except that fields may be repeated,
deleted, or random. In the latter case, the field accountability data
consist of unique field identifiers.
    3.3.9.2.3 FREE TEXT MESSAGE
Free text messages are used for the transmission of voice data and other data
not in a predefined format. Only one free text message may be transmitted in
a time slot. The maximum size of the message depends on whether or not the
message is Reed-Solomon encoded and what message packing format is used.
    3.3.9.3 HEADER WORD
A 35-bit header word is included once in each transmission (except those time
slots used for RTT messages) to provide information concerning all messages
transmitted in the time slot. Table 3.3-6 contains the information found in
the header word. The header word is always encoded into a (16, 7) ReedSolomon codeword (see paragraph 3.3.3.2.3).
    3.3.10 ROUND TRIP TIMING MESSAGE PACKING STRUCTURE
RTT messages are used only to establish and maintain fine synchronization
(see paragraph 3.3.2.4). The RTT Interrogation message and RTT Reply message

```

-----

```
contain 32 pulses in the synchronization preamble, 8 pulses in the TR
segment, and 32 pulses in the data portion. The header word associated with
data messages (see paragraph 3.3.9.3) is not transmitted with RTT messages. 
Instead, necessary header type information (e.g., SDU serial number) is
included in the RTT message. The data portion of an RTT Interrogation
message and an RTT Reply message consists of 16 symbols. These symbols
convey (16,7) Reed-Solomon codeword representing 35 bits of coded
information. The three types of RTT messages are characterized in Table 3.38 and are discussed below.
    a. RTT-A Interrogation Message. This message is addressed to a
specific unit and requests that the addressed unit respond with an RTT Reply
message.
    b. RTT-B Interrogation Message. This message is unaddressed and those
active units with clock accuracy (Qt) equal to the clock accuracy specified in
the RTT-B message respond with an RTT Reply message. An interrogating JU
specifies, in its Interrogation message, a time quality that exceeds its own
time quality. The Interrogation message and Reply message are transmitted on
the net having a number equal to the time quality specified in the
Interrogation message.
    c. RTT Reply Message. This message is transmitted in response to RTTA and RTT-B Interrogation messages to complete the active fine
synchronization process.

###### SECTION 4

 4. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

 4.1 GENERAL

 This section describes the general requirements for exchange of digital data

 within the interface. This interface consists of participating Link 16 units

 and includes the forwarding Link 11/11B Units. The requirements for the

 individual messages and their transmit/receive (T/R) rules are contained in

 Section 5. Minimum implementation requirements for the messages are

 contained in Appendix A. Appendix B is the Data Element Dictionary. Data

 forwarding rules for the interface are provided in Appendix C. Message, data

 element, and data item implementation by system are provided in Appendix D

 and the Classified Supplement. Appendix E is the ICP repository for those

 ICPs that are approved by the CCB for inclusion in MIL-STD-6016.

 4.1.1 MESSAGE STANDARD FUNCTIONAL AREAS

 The Link 16 interface has been divided into functional areas as follows:

 a. System Information Exchange and Network Management.

 b. Precise Participant Location and Identification (PPLI).

 c. Air Surveillance.

 d. Surface (Maritime) Surveillance.

 e. Subsurface (Maritime) Surveillance.

 f. Land (Ground) Surveillance.

 g. Space Surveillance

 h. Electronic Surveillance.

 i. Electronic Warfare (EW)/Intelligence.


-----

###### j. Mission Management.

 k. Weapons Coordination and Management.

 l. Control.

 m. Information Management.

 The relationship of these Link 16 functional areas to the warfare tasks is

 shown in Table 4.1-1. Relationships among the functions may be used to group

 them logically for making maximum use of the Joint Tactical Information

 Distribution System (JTIDS) netting and system capacity.

 The functions are strongly interdependent because most tasks require the use

 of several functions. The System Information Exchange and Network

 Management, PPLI, and Information Management functions are essential to the

 successful employment of almost all of the other functions. The Surveillance

 functions all require the same set of supporting functions, while broader

 functions such as Mission Management, Weapons Coordination and Management,

 and Control require varying degrees of support from most of the other

 functions.

 Participation in each functional area includes adherence to required JTIDS

 Unit (JU) Response Times (Tables 4.1-2 and 4.1-3), message update rates

 (Table 4.1-3), priorities of message transmission, T/R rules, and the minimum

 implementation. JU Response Time is defined as the time from new information

 availability at the JU to the transmission of the information on the link. 

 JU Response Times will vary with the criticality of the information being

 transmitted. As an example, Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) Control

 information is more critical than Surface (Maritime) Surveillance

 information. Message update rate is defined as the periodicity of a message

 transmission on the link. A message update rate of not applicable (NA) in

 Table 4.1-3 indicates that the message will be updated when new information

 is available instead of on a periodic basis.

###### 4.1.2 DESCRIPTION OF INTERFACE UNITS

 Units are specified by the communication function they accomplish; the

 following definitions for units apply throughout this document:

 a. Interface Unit (IU). A generic term that applies to JTIDS Units

 (JUs), Participating Units (PUs), and Reporting Units (RUs) providing

 information to the interface.

 b. JTIDS Unit (JU). A unit communicating directly on Link 16.

 c. Command and Control JTIDS Unit (C[2] JU). A JTIDS unit with command
 and control (C[2]) capability communicating directly on Link 16.

 d. Noncommand and Control JTIDS Unit (nonC[2] JU). A JTIDS unit other
 than a C[2] JU communicating directly on Link 16.

 e. Participating Unit (PU). A unit communicating directly on Link 11.

 f. Reporting Unit (RU). A unit taking part in the exchange or

 transfer of tactical data on a point-to-point data link to which data can be

 addressed, and from which data can be identified as to source.

 g. Indirect Unit. A PU or RU that is being forwarded onto Link 16.

 h. Supporting Unit (SU). A unit operating in support of a JU, a PU,

 or an RU which is providing data for the interface but which is not

 specifically identified as a data source.

 i. Forwarding JTIDS Unit (FJU). A JU that translates and forwards

 data among units using J-Series messages and M-Series messages. An FJU can

 function in one of the configurations illustrated in Figure 4.1-1. These

 configurations are described below:

 (1) Forwarding JTIDS Unit A (FJUA). A unit communicating on

 both Link 11 and Link 16 while forwarding information between Link 11 and

 Link 16 participants.


-----

###### (2) Forwarding JTIDS Unit B (FJUB). A unit communicating on

 both Link 11 and Link 16 while forwarding information between Link 11 and

 Link 16 participants.

 (3) Forwarding JTIDS Unit AB (FJUAB). A unit communicating on

 Link 16, Link 11, and Link 11B while forwarding information among Link 16,

 Link 11, and Link 11B participants.

 j. Forwarding Participating Unit (FPU). A PU which is forwarding data

 between Link 11 and one or more RUs.

 k. Forwarding Reporting Unit (FRU). An RU which is forwarding data

 between two or more RUs.


-----

###### Figure 4.1-1. Representative FJU Link Configurations


-----

###### 4.1.3 TRACK/ADDRESS NUMBERING

 A track number (TN) is used to provide a common reference number for

 information and directives exchanged within the interface. The reference

 numbers are used for both digital and voice communications to denote all IUs

 and/or tactical information reports, e.g., tracks. For the purpose of TN

 assignment, tactical information reporting includes reference numbers

 assigned to all tracks, strobes, bearing lines, and points exchanged on the

 interface. When applied to an IU, such a number is termed an address; when

 applied to a point, it may be an address or TN, as appropriate. In the

 message, the address is termed "Source TN" when used to identify the IU

 originating the data and is termed "Addressee TN" when used to identify the

 IU that is to receive the data.

 4.1.3.1 TRACK NUMBER SEQUENCE AND USE

 a. Whenever TNs are assigned sequentially, the sequence shall be

 determined by binary addition. The 19-bit Link 16 TN is composed of two 5
 bit groups followed by three 3-bit groups, for a total of five characters. 

 The 5-bit groups have a range of meaning of 0 through 7 or A through Z, less

 I and O. The 3-bit groups are always numeric, 0 through 7. Due to this

 composition, the 15-bit JU addresses are not the same as the 15 least

 significant bits (LSBs) of the 19-bit TN, but the 12-bit Link 11/11B TNs are

 the same as the 12 LSBs of the 19-bit TN. For display and database purposes,

 a 15-bit address is the same TN as the 19-bit TN composed of the same octal

 numbers. The purely numeric 5-digit Link 16 addresses and TNs are embedded

 between sequences containing 5-character alphanumeric TNs. By binary

 addition, the next 19-bit TN after the octal number 07777 is alphanumeric

 (octal) 0A000, not the octal number 10000. Figure 4.1-2 illustrates the

 composition and coding of the 19-bit TNs.

 b. Table 4.1-4 specifies the complete sequence and use of Link 11,

 11B, and 16 TNs. There are a total of 32,764 numeric TNs available for

 allocation as 15-bit addresses or 19-bit surveillance TNs (the octal numbers

 00000, 00077, 00177, and 07777 cannot be allocated); and 491,520 alphanumeric

 TNs, each containing one or two letters, available for allocation as 19-bit

 surveillance TNs. Operational procedures will ensure that TNs are normally

 allocated in blocks which are entirely numeric or entirely alphanumeric, not


-----

###### a mixture. Operational procedures will further ensure that addresses are

 allocated from within a block or blocks which are not allocated for use as

 surveillance TNs to insure against the duplicate TN situation which could

 occur if an address is the same as a TN within an allocated block of

 surveillance TNs. No specific block(s) of TNs is reserved for this purpose,

 although testing or operational experience may dictate the need to do so. In

 an interface with Link 11 and/or 11B units, the block of TNs allocated as JU

 addresses should be below the octal number 07777 to ensure that a JU has one

 and only one TN throughout a Link 11/11B/16 interface. Furthermore,
 operational procedures will ensure that C[2] JUs which expect to exchange

 addressed messages with Link 11/11B units must be assigned an address below

 the octal number 00176.

###### 4.1.3.2 ADDRESS ALLOCATION

 The octal number 00000 is reserved as No Statement. The octal number 77777

 is reserved as the Network Manager address. (The actual unit address for the

 Network Manager will not be the octal number 77777.) The octal number 00176

 is reserved as the pseudo source track number address (See Appendix C, Data

 Forwarding). The octal number 00177 is reserved as a collective address and

 is not assignable as a unit address. The octal numbers 00077 and 07777 are

 illegal (not used) for use on the interface. Addresses for units operating

 on Link 11 (PUs, FPUs, FJUAs, and FJUABs) shall be assigned from the block of

 octal numbers 00001 through 00076. Addresses for units operating on Link 11B

 (RUs, FRUs, and FJUBs) shall be assigned addresses from the block of octal
 numbers 00100 through 00175. C[2] JU addresses shall be assigned from the

 blocks of octal numbers 00001 through 00076, 00100 through 00175, 00200

 through 07776, and 10000 through 77776. To exchange addressed messages with
 Link 11/11B units, a C[2] JU must be assigned an address from the blocks of

 octal numbers 00001 through 00076 and 00100 through 00175. Addresses for
 nonC[2] JUs shall be assigned from the blocks of octal numbers 00200 through

 07776 and 10000 through 77776.

 4.1.3.3 TRACK NUMBER ALLOCATION

 Based upon each interfacing system's requirements, blocks of contiguous

 numbers shall be allocated to each system for use in reporting tactical

 information. A system may subdivide its block(s) for allocation to

 subordinate units. Each unit should be allocated a larger number of TNs than

 its local track capacity to provide the capability to report tracks when some

 of its TNs are being used by other units as a result of shifts in reporting
 responsibility (R[2]).

 TN blocks are assigned to PUs, FPUs, RUs, FRUs, FJUAs, FJUBs, and FJUABs from
 the octal numbers 00200 through 07776. TN blocks are assigned to C[2] JUs from

 the octal numbers 00200 through 07776 (low TNs), 10000 through 77776 (high

 TNs), and alphanumeric (octal) block 0A000 through ZZ777 (high TNs). In an
 interface with Link 11 or Link 11B units, the block of TNs allocated to C[2]

 Units for the reporting of tracks, points, or lines of bearing (LOBs) should

 be limited (when possible) to values below the octal number 07777 so that the

 TN can be equated to the Link 11/11B TN. When track volume requires


-----

###### additional numbers, TN values greater than the octal number 07777 may be used

 but the equating of TNs will not be possible. In a mixed IJMS/Link 16

 environment, the TN block(s) should be limited (when possible) to values

 below the octal number 77777 so that the TN can be equated to the Link

 16/IJMS TN. If additional TNs are required, Track Numbers greater than 77777

 octal may be used but the equating of TNs will not be possible. Systems

 operating on more than one data link shall, equate TNs between the links,

 such that the decimal value representation will be the same. To accomplish

 this, systems must be assigned track blocks among multiple links to allow for

 equating of TNs.

 It is understood that there will be instances that will preclude limiting

 track numbers. It is also understood that even if track numbers are limited

 there will be instances where a unit will be unable to equate TNs because of

 a specific TN in use. In both of these cases, TNs will not be able to be

 equated.

 C[2] JUs shall be capable of accepting a minimum of two separate noncontiguous

 blocks of TNs, including a low TN block and a high TN block, from any of

 these specified ranges. An FJU shall also be capable of accepting a Data

 Forwarding TN block in the range 00200-07776 for use in TN association. The

 Data Forwarding TN block is not required to be contiguous with or a subset of

 the low TN block allocated to the FJU's host IU.

 Table 4.1-4 summarizes the allocation of TNs.

 4.1.3.4 ADDRESS ASSIGNMENT

 Each interfacing unit on Link 16 shall be assigned a specific TN for use as

 its address prior to joining the interface. An interfacing unit on Link 16

 shall be capable of accepting any assigned address within the range of TNs

 allocated as addresses.

 4.1.3.5 TRACK NUMBER ASSIGNMENT

 Each subset of tactical information including air tracks, surface (maritime)

 tracks, subsurface (maritime) tracks, land (ground) tracks, bearings, fixes,

 and/or points, that is originated by a unit and reported within the interface


-----

###### shall be assigned a TN from the block(s) allocated to that system or unit. 
 In addition, all C[2] units shall have the capability to manually assign

 individual TNs outside their allocated block. Each system shall ensure that

 two different tracks are not reported using the same TN, and that multiple

 TNs are not assigned to the same track. Each system may establish its own

 criteria for the initiation of tracks and for TN assignment and reporting

 within the interface. An SU shall be assigned a TN from the parent IU or

 unit TN allocation.

 4.1.3.6 TRACK NUMBER ACCOUNTABILITY

 Each C[2] IU shall be responsible for maintaining accountability of TNs. Once a

 TN has been assigned for reporting tactical information, that TN shall be

 associated with that track data for as long as the data are reported within
 the interface, regardless of which unit is reporting the data. Each C[2] JU

 shall normally assign TNs from its allocated block(s), cycling through the

 block(s) and skipping those numbers known to be in use. After an IU has

 cycled through the block(s) for the first time, TNs must be reassigned again,

 skipping those in current use, in such a way to preclude the confusion that

 can occur when the reporting of specific data is terminated and the TN is

 immediately reassigned. When both a low TN and a high TN block are

 allocated, the low TNs shall be eligible for reassignment when the upper

 limit of the low TN block is reached. Normally, the high TNs will be

 assigned only when no low TN is eligible for assignment or reassignment. 
 Data filters, lack of correlation, or other problems may prevent a C[2] JU from

 recognizing that a track is being reported with a given TN. As a result,

 either or both of two ambiguous conditions may occur:

 a. Dual Designation/Track Number Conflict. The same track is being

 reported by two or more units using two or more different TNs. Procedures

 for the prevention (i.e., correlation) and resolution of dual designations

 are described in paragraphs 4.4.4.3.1 and 4.7.3, respectively.

 b. Duplicate TNs. The same TN is being used by two or more units to

 report two or more different tracks.


-----

###### 4.1.3.7 RESOLUTION OF DUPLICATE TRACK NUMBER

 The resolution of duplicate TN reporting requires that agreement be reached

 via voice coordination among the conflicting units as to which track will

 carry the TN in use. All other tracks in question shall then be assigned

 their own specific TN. To minimize the probability of duplicate TNs, each

 unit shall assign TNs sequentially from its allocated block(s), cycling

 through the block(s) and skipping those numbers known to be in use.

 4.1.4 DATA REGISTRATION

 Data registration is a condition of correct relative alignment between local

 and remote track positional data. It involves measuring, computing,

 converting, transforming and adjusting positional data. Optimum interface

 data registration occurs when all the IUs hold their locally derived track

 positional data at the same geodetic position as the remote positional data

 for the same interface tracks. Geodetic position is defined in terms of

 latitude, longitude, and altitude in reference to an earth model.

 The exchange of track positional data is fundamental to the operation of an

 interface. IUs which receive these reported tracks must attempt to correlate

 these tracks with local data. The correlation process is compounded as

 either the remote or local positional errors increase. The combination of

 remote track positional errors coupled with local track positional errors may

 result in dual designations.

 In addition to accuracy requirements for track correlation, the use of remote

 data by systems using over-the-horizon targeting and remote intercept control

 have increased remote positional accuracy requirements.

 4.1.4.1 DATA REGISTRATION ERROR SOURCES

 Identified in this subsection are sources of error in data registration that

 occur in each of the participating IUs. The magnitude of the errors varies

 according to the characteristics and configuration of each IU. For example,

 a stationary JU which has been accurately surveyed has less potential errors

 in the PPLI reports than a moving JU with limited navigational capability. 

 Each individual IU has various combinations of sensors, data processors,


-----

###### software techniques, etc., which comprise the total operational

 configuration.

 The errors which impact data registration have been identified as follows:

 a. Geodetic position errors.

 b. Sensor errors.

 c. Data processing errors.

 d. Remote unit errors.

 Table 4.1-5 summarizes these error sources. They are discussed in greater

 detail in the paragraphs that follow.

 4.1.4.1.1 GEODETIC POSITION ERRORS

 Geodetic position errors are associated with each JU's ability to determine

 its position in terms of geodetic latitude, longitude, and altitude. They

 are defined as the difference between the JU's reported position and the JU's

 position relative to the reference spheroid (normally World Geodetic System
 84 (WGS-84)). Stationary JUs usually determine geodetic position through

 site surveys which are accomplished prior to link participation. Moving JUs

 derive geodetic position in real-time from the JU's navigation systems and

 other navigation aids (e.g., OMEGA, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), Global

 Positioning System (GPS), etc.).


-----

###### TABLE 4.1-5. Summary of Data Registration Error Sources

|ERROR SOURCES|CAUSE OF ERROR|COMMENT|
|---|---|---|
|GEODETIC POSITION|INABILITY TO LOCATE OWN UNIT'S POSITION RELATIVE TO AN EARTH MODEL (NORMALLY WGS-84).|ERROR IN GEODETIC LONGITUDE ERROR IN GEODETIC LATITUDE ERROR IN ALTITUDE|
|SENSOR (ALIGNMENT AND CALIBRATION)|BIAS ERRORS IN THE JU SENSOR'S AZIMUTH ORIENTATION, VERTICAL ORIENTATION (NORMAL TO TANGENT PLANE AT GEODETIC POSITION), AND RANGING MEASUREMENTS.|ERROR IN SENSOR AZIMUTH ERROR IN SENSOR ELEVATION ERROR IN SENSOR RANGE NOTE: ERRORS IN THE NORTH SEEKING DEVICE ARE INCLUDED IN THE SENSOR AZIMUTH ERROR.|

|REMOTE UNITS|RESIDUAL ERRORS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH REMOTE UNITS.|PERFORMED ON INDIVIDUAL REMOTE UNITS WITH CORRECTION FACTORS CALCULATED IN TERMS OF MEAN TRANSLATIONAL AND MEAN ROTATIONAL PARAMETERS. THESE FACTORS ARE APPLIED TO POSITIONAL DATA RECEIVED FROM EACH INDIVIDUAL REMOTE UNIT.|


-----

###### Geodetic position errors affect the position reported in PPLI messages and

 the location of the coordinate center used for coordinate transformation

 equations. Coordinate transformations are performed between the JU's local

 tangent plane and geodetic position. If geodetic position errors are

 significantly large, not only are the reported tracks subjected to position

 errors, but also the JU's ability to correctly correlate/decorrelate local

 and remote tracks is seriously degraded.

 Geodetic position errors are expressed as follows:

 a. Delta longitude.

 b. Delta latitude.

 c. Delta altitude.

 4.1.4.1.2 SENSOR ERRORS

 Inherent in the operation of active and passive sensors are procedures

 required to align and calibrate the sensors' measurement systems. Normally,

 these procedures are accomplished prior to participation in an interface. 

 However, due to errors in the basic alignment procedures and random

 measurement variables, i.e., noise drifts, index of refraction, etc., the

 sensor may be subjected to significant errors. These sensor errors are

 identified as follows:

 a. Elevation errors.

 b. Azimuth errors.

 c. Ranging errors.

 In addition, the inability of the JU to correctly sense north orientation

 introduces another source of error. This error, however, is compensated for

 when corrections are applied in the sensor's azimuth alignment during the

 sensor error correction process.


-----

###### 4.1.4.1.3 DATA PROCESSING ERRORS

 Data processing errors arise from the coordinate systems utilized, the

 equations used with coordinate system transformations and conversions, the

 basic algorithms employed in the data processing, and the procedures used to

 extrapolate the measured data from the time of observation to the reported

 time.

 Typical coordinate systems utilized by the JUs include the sensor oriented

 system that uses range, azimuth, and elevation; the rectangular coordinate

 system oriented in the tangent plane that uses north, east, and up; and the

 geodetic system which is usually modeled to WGS-84. These systems are used

 to transform the JU's sensor data into track position and velocity data which

 are used in the tracking function. The tracking function includes processes

 such as data smoothing, track initiation, and track updating. The equations

 utilized for these transformations may cause errors in excess of acceptable

 levels if they are not implemented to reflect accuracy requirements.

 In addition, software supporting algorithms such as sine and cosine routines

 must also be implemented in such a manner as to minimize inaccuracies.

 Extrapolation of track data must also be considered within data processing

 schemes. It is incumbent upon each JU to ensure that track positions

 accurately reflect time of observation. This is done by time tagging. 

 Extrapolation and time tagging of tracks can ensure that the local/remote

 correlation and decorrelation process can account for time and position

 differences.

 4.1.4.1.4 REMOTE IU ERRORS

 All IUs which originate track positional data are subject to the errors noted

 above. It is anticipated that all units will attempt to minimize such

 errors. Under optimum conditions the results of these efforts will cause the

 overall data registration picture (local-to-remote differences) to be

 acceptable. However, under operational conditions it can happen that one or

 more units will have residual errors which cause unacceptable differences in

 local-to-remote positional data. Remote IU errors are measured by observing

 the positional difference between local track positions and remote track


-----

###### positions received from a specific remote unit. Remote IU errors are due to

 differences in geodetic and sensor registration between own unit and a

 selected remote IU.

 4.1.4.2 DATA REGISTRATION MONITORING AND ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURES

 Each JU which participates in the Surveillance function and has the
 capability to initiate or assume R[2] for surveillance tracks shall have the

 capability to perform data registration. These JUs shall have the capability

 to make periodic adjustments in accordance with the following generalized

 criteria:

 a. JUs shall have the capability to perform monitoring and adjustment

 of data registration procedures using automatic or manual means.

 b. Monitoring and computing of data registration should be performed

 with minimal interference to, or curtailment of, normal data system

 operation.

 c. Results of data registration monitoring and adjustments shall be

 available for operator appreciation.

 The procedures that are required to minimize the data registration errors

 identified in paragraph 4.1.4.1 are as follows:

 a. Geodetic registration.

 b. Sensor registration.

 c. Data processing accuracy.

 d. Remote unit registration.

 Figure 4.1-3 is a simplified diagram of a typical data registration process. 

 Figures 4.1-4 and 4.1-5 contain descriptions of the various coordinate

 systems used in the data registration process. The sensor system consists of

 range, azimuth, and elevation expressed as R, AZ, and EL respectively. R,

 AZ, and EL data are then transformed into an IU coordinate set defined with


-----

###### X, Y, and Z where X equals east, Y equals true north and Z equals geodetic

 vertical. For JTIDS interface operation, the X, Y, and Z data are

 transformed into the Geodetic Coordinate System. This system is modeled

 using WGS-84 with target location expressed as φ for geodetic latitude, λ for

 geodetic longitude, and H for altitude.

###### Figure 4.1-5. Description of Geodetic Coordinate System


-----

###### 4.1.4.2.1 GEODETIC REGISTRATION

 Geodetic registration is defined as a process in which a JU monitors its

 reported geodetic positional data and periodically adjusts this geodetic data

 with information derived from active participation in the JTIDS/MIDS Relative

 Navigation function. Geodetic registration begins with a capability of the

 JU to determine and maintain accurate positional coordinates in terms of

 geodetic latitude, longitude, and altitude. Monitoring of relative geodetic

 position is provided by active participation in the JTIDS/MIDS Relative

 Navigation function during netted operation. Through active participation in

 the JTIDS/MIDS Relative Navigation function, highly accurate adjustments to

 the reported geodetic position are obtainable. The JTIDS/MIDS terminal will

 provide Relative Navigation adjustments to the host platform in terms of

 latitude correction (LATC), longitude correction (LONC), and altitude

 correction (HC). These correction factors shall be periodically applied to

 the own unit's latitude, longitude, and altitude used for the coordinate

 transformations defined in paragraph 4.1.4.2.3.

 4.1.4.2.2 SENSOR REGISTRATION

 Sensor registration is the process of determining and maintaining the correct

 alignment of the sensor elements used for the measurement of a tracked

 object's position. Monitoring is accomplished by comparing the geodetic

 position of a remote unit reported in the PPLI messages and the remote unit's

 position observed through active local sensors. This procedure requires that

 each JU periodically monitor the remote units and, through analysis

 techniques, calculate the mean correction variations in terms of difference

 in azimuth expressed as ΔAZ, difference in elevation expressed as ΔEL, and

 difference in range expressed as ΔR.

 Each JU which participates in the Surveillance function shall have the

 capability to periodically monitor sensor registration using remote unit PPLI

 messages and local sensor returns. Periodically, the JU shall adjust sensor

 registration in accordance with the following criteria:

 a. Remote IUs which are used in the sensor registration process may be

 selected either manually or automatically.


-----

###### b. The statistical method used in determining sensor errors shall

 consider:

 (1) The sampling interval.

 (2) The minimum number of remote units necessary to ensure

 reliable data.

 (3) PPLI position, azimuth, and time quality values.

 (4) Quadrant distribution of the remote IUs used.

 (5) Maximum and minimum range criteria of remote units; and

 (6) Altitude data availability in both the received PPLI

 messages and local sensor data.

 c. Results of the sensor registration shall be available for operator

 appreciation in the form of ΔAZ, ΔEL, and ΔR.

 d. It is a design goal that the sensor registration process detect and

 correct sensor errors so that the azimuth/elevation angle errors shall not

 exceed one-half degree and range errors shall not exceed 500 feet.

 4.1.4.2.3 DATA PROCESSING ACCURACY

 This paragraph discusses the data processing accuracies required of a

 participating JU when calculating, converting, and transforming local and

 remote track data. These accuracies are directly related to the basic

 equations used to perform the various conversions and transformations, the

 assumptions and algorithms used in this process, and the time and position

 relationship associated with the track information. The track data

 requirements specified in this paragraph apply to positional data received in

 J2 and J3 messages, as well as locally derived data.

 Each JU must include in its local and remote track data processing the time

 tag associated with a track position report. JUs shall ensure that all track


-----

###### positions are extrapolated when local and remote correlation and

 decorrelation is performed.

 In addition to the extrapolation requirement, the JU must insure that the

 equations and assumptions employed in the processing, conversion, and

 transformation of positional data conform to the following accuracy

 requirements:

 a. The processing accuracy of locally input positional coordinates

 into geodetic latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates shall be within

 plus or minus 60 feet.

 b. The processing accuracy of remote data such as latitude, longitude,

 and altitude into local database coordinates shall be within plus or minus 60

 feet.

 c. When positional data are received by an FJU, the processing

 accuracy of the forwarded positional data shall be within plus or minus 60

 feet.

 d. The processing accuracy for the conversion of (X dot, Y dot)

 velocity coordinates into course and speed, or the conversion of course and

 speed into (X dot, Y dot) coordinates shall be within plus or minus .1 dm/hr

 for linear parameters and plus or minus .05 degrees for course.

 The required data processing accuracy shall be obtainable within the

 following positional and geographical limits:

 a. The distance of the track from the receiving or transmitting unit

 is less than 250 data miles.

 b. The geodetic latitude of the JU is between 70° south latitude and

 70° north latitude.

 c. The geodetic altitude of the track is between 120,000 feet above

 and 1,000 feet below the reference spheroid measured along the geodetic

 vertical.


-----

###### The above accuracy requirements are based on a comparison with exact

 mathematical conversions and transformations using the WGS-84 earth model as

 the reference spheroid with the following parameters:

 a. Primary parameters are as follows:

 (1) Semi-Major axis, a is equal to 6,378,137 meters 

 (3,487.607721 data miles).

 (2) Flattening, f is equal to 1/298.257223563.

 b. Secondary parameters are as follows:

 (1) Semi-Minor axis, b is equal to 6,356,752.3142 meters

 (3,475.9144 data miles).

 (2) Major Eccentricity, e = 0.0818191908426.

 Standard units of measure are as follows:

 a. 1 nautical mile is equal to 1,852 meters, (International Nautical

 Mile adopted by Department of Defense (DOD), 1 July 1954).

 b. 1 ft is equal to 0.3048 meters (DOD Standard 1476, 1 August 1977).

 c. 1 data mile is equal to 6,000 feet (U.S.) = 1,828.8 meters.

 d. 1 nautical mile is equal to 1.012685914 data miles.

 To prevent any ambiguity, the geodetic latitude and longitude data exchanged

 in the interface are defined as WGS-84 latitude and longitude.

 The exact mathematical equations depicted in Figure 4.1-6 shall be used by

 tactical data systems using orthogonal projections as the standard for

 comparison when determining a system's capability to meet the accuracy

 requirements of paragraph 4.1.4.2.3. Tactical data systems using other

 projections, e.g., stereographic, shall use equations that also meet the

 stated accuracy requirements.

###### 4.1.4.2.4 REMOTE IU REGISTRATION

 Remote IU registration is the procedure for determining data registration

 corrective values by comparing remote tracks received from a selected remote

 IU to local data and applying corrective values to positional data received
 from that IU. Each IU which has a capability to initiate or assume R[2] for

 real-time surveillance tracks will have a capability to periodically monitor

 its data registration relative to a selected IU and to make periodic

 adjustments in accordance with the following criteria:

 a. Either automatic or manual selection of remote IUs for monitoring

 and adjustment of data registration shall be used.

 b. The periodic performance of the remote IU registration procedure

 for selected units shall be automatically conducted at least once per monitor

 interval as specified in Table 4.1-6.

 tracks with track quality (TQ) greater than or equal to 4 for at least six

 update cycles. Azimuth separation should be at least 45°.

-----

###### d. The execution of the remote IU registration should be performed

 without interference or curtailment of normal data system operations.

 e. Results of remote IU registration shall be available for operator

 appreciation in the form of the most recently computed mean translational

 error/difference in X and Y (data miles) and the mean rotational

 error/difference (degrees of azimuth) for each remote IU designated for

 remote IU registration.

 f. It is a design goal that the remote IU registration function will

 detect and adjust registration errors before they exceed two data miles for X

 and Y, and one-half degree of azimuth.

 4.1.5 IDENTIFICATION OF DATA SOURCE

 Identification of the source of data on the interface is provided by the

 Source TN field. The Source TN field is a discrete address assigned to each

 IU.

 4.1.6 SPECIAL PROCESSING

 Certain national systems provide surveillance and warning information of a

 particularly sensitive nature. Link 16 makes provision for the protection of

 the source of such information through the use of the Special Processing

 Indicator (SPI). The SPI shall not be used for any other purpose. In

 particular, setting the SPI to value 1 shall not permit any other field of

 the message to be encoded differently from that defined by the message

 standard. The setting of the SPI by units originating data shall be in

 accordance with national requirements. When the SPI is set to value 1, it

 indicates that the information in the message in which it appears requires

 special handling and processing as defined in the following paragraphs.

 4.1.6.1 DATA CONSTRAINTS

 a. All surveillance, warning and amplification data in messages in

 which the SPI is set to value 1 shall be classified SECRET, and on reception

 shall be afforded the protection commensurate with that classification.


-----

###### b. Data protected by the SPI set to value 1 shall be transmitted on

 Link 16 only if the terminal or other communication path is operating in a

 secure mode.

 c. Data protected by the SPI set to value 1 shall not be transmitted

 on Link 16 if there are any units on the interface which are unable to

 protect the data according to its classification.

 4.1.6.2 FORWARDING OF DATA PROTECTED BY THE SPI

 Data which is protected by the SPI set to value 1 shall not be forwarded onto

 unsecured links or voice circuit. A unit which is forwarding Link 16 to Link

 11 shall adhere to the constraints for data protected by the SPI, in

 accordance with the procedures in MIL-STD 6016, Appendix C.

 4.1.6.3 SECURITY FILTERING

 All units which are capable of transmitting data protected by the SPI shall

 also implement a security transmit filter to inhibit such transmissions. The

 security filter shall be overridden by an Emergency or Force Tell alert on a

 reported entity.

 4.1.6.4 CHANGE OF REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR A SPI TRACK

 If a C[2] unit assumes R[2] for a track which was previously reported with the SPI

 set to value 1, the unit shall have the option of retaining the original

 value or of clearing it to value 0, in accordance with national requirements.

 4.1.6.5 SPECIAL PROCESSING OF EW DATA

 The SPI in the J3.7 and J14.0 is used to indicate the security processing

 status of LOBs, AOPs, and fixes reported in those messages. The value of the

 SPI shall be set at the discretion of the reporting unit, in accordance with

 national requirements and independent of the setting of the SPI in

 contributing LOBs, AOPs, or fixes. However, if all contributions have their

 SPI set to value 1, the AOP or fix shall be reported with the SPI set to

 value 1.


-----

###### 4.1.7 RECEIPT/COMPLIANCE

 Link 16 messages that are not generated in response to another message are

 called original messages (OMs) or original orders. Some addressed OMs have a

 receipt/compliance (R/C) field and require response messages to be

 transmitted by the receiving unit to indicate that the OM has been received

 and, if desired, also to indicate whether the receiving unit will accomplish

 the action identified in the OM. Response messages contain an R/C field

 which indicates the response being returned.

 The receipt/compliance procedures for the messages used for Link 16 network

 management are different than those for operational messages. "Network

 management messages" as used herein refers to J0, J1, J8, and J31 series

 messages containing an R/C field. "Operational messages" as used herein

 refers to J9, J10, J12, and J14 series messages containing an R/C field. 

 Table 4.1-7 provides the data item names, data item code values, and data

 item explanations for the R/C field. Table 4.1-8 specifies the applicability

 of the various R/C data items to the J series messages for transmission of

 original messages and receipt of original messages. Table 4.1-8.1 specifies

 the applicability of the various R/C data items to the J series messages for

 response to original messages and receipt of responses to original messages. 

 Table 4.1-9 describes examples of the interchange when original and response

 messages are exchanged between JUs.

 4.1.7.1 ORIGINAL MESSAGE

 An R/C field in the OM specifies whether a response message is to be returned

 to the originator. If the R/C field is set to value 0, then a response

 message is required. If the R/C field is set to value 5, then only a machine

 receipt (MR) message and/or automatic computer generated response is

 required. If the R/C field is set to value 1, then no response message is

 required. The R/C field of an OM addressed to more than one unit shall be

 set to value 1.

 4.1.7.2 MACHINE RECEIPT

 A machine receipt message has the R/C field set to value 2 and shall be

 transmitted once by an addressed terminal upon receipt of either a valid OM


-----

###### with the R/C field set to value 0 or 5 or upon receipt of a response message

 with the R/C field set to a value greater than 2. In the network management

 messages, the machine receipt is equivalent to a WILCO message. Therefore, a

 machine receipt for a network management OM shall only be sent if the

 addressed terminal can accept and execute the actions specified in the OM.

 The machine receipt message shall be transmitted in the time slot specified

 by the Recurrence Rate, Receipt/Compliance field of the message it is

 responding to. The machine receipt message shall be identical to the message

 it is responding to except in the Source TN; Relayed Transmission Indicator;

 Message Length Indicator; Addressee TN; R/C; and Recurrence Rate,

 Receipt/Compliance fields. The Recurrence Rate, Receipt Compliance field

 shall be set to the No Statement value in all machine receipt messages. A

 response message with the R/C field set to a value greater than 2 may be

 transmitted in lieu of the machine receipt message. A CANTPRO message must

 be transmitted in lieu of a machine receipt message if the addressed terminal

 cannot accept and execute the action specified in a network management OM.

 4.1.7.3 CANNOT PROCESS RESPONSE

 An appropriate CANTPRO response message shall be transmitted automatically by

 an addressed unit upon receipt of an OM with the R/C field set to value 0 or

 value 5 if the message cannot be processed. The R/C field of the CANTPRO

 response message shall indicate the reason the message cannot be processed. 

 This is an automatic computer generated response and the operator need not be

 aware that any order has been received or that the CANTPRO response has been

 generated. The CANTPRO response message shall be identical to the OM it is

 responding to except in the Source TN; Relayed Transmission Indicator;

 Addressee TN; R/C; and Recurrence Rate, Receipt/Compliance fields.

###### 4.1.7.4 SYSTEM COMPONENT RESPONSE

 System component response messages of WILCO, HAVCO, or CANTCO are normally

 initiated in response to OMs with the R/C field set to value 0. For HAVCO a

 system component may be a human or a machine. For WILCO and CANTCO the

 system component is a human or (unmanned vehicle only) a machine. The system

 component response message shall mirror the OM to which it is responding but

 with the following modifications:

 a. The Source TN; Relayed Transmission Indicator; Addressee TN; R/C;

 and Recurrence Rate, Receipt/Compliance fields.

 b. For message words/data fields, which shall be added/deleted when

 required by the individual message transmit rules.

 4.1.7.5 RETRANSMISSION OF ORIGINAL MESSAGES

 When an OM with the R/C field set to value 0 or value 5 is sent, a copy of

 the message shall be saved by the initiating terminal. When the Recurrence

 Rate, Receipt/Compliance field in the OM is set to the value 0, No Statement,

 the terminal shall automatically retransmit the OM if a machine receipt

 message or response message that serves as a machine receipt message is not

 received after 64 time slots from the transmission of the OM. The

 retransmission process is performed twice. When the Recurrence Rate,

 Receipt/Compliance field is set to a value other than 0, the terminal shall

 retransmit the OM if a response message is not received in the donated time

 slot. The retransmission process is performed twice. If a response message

 has not been received after the completion of either of the two conditions

 described, the terminal shall provide an operator alert.

 An OM with the R/C field set to value 1 shall be transmitted 3 times with a

 Recurrence Rate Number (RRN) equal to 6(12 seconds, 8-20 second interval) and

 shall not require any response message.

 4.1.7.6 RETRANSMISSION OF RESPONSE MESSAGES

 Response messages with the R/C field not equal to value 2 shall be saved by

 the terminal initiating the response message until the expected machine


-----

###### receipt message is received. When the Recurrence Rate, Receipt/Compliance

 field is set to value 0, No Statement, the terminal shall automatically

 retransmit the response message if a machine receipt message is not received

 after 64 time slots from transmission of the OM. The retransmission process

 is performed twice. When the Recurrence Rate, Receipt/Compliance field is

 set to a value other than 0, the terminal shall retransmit the response

 message if a machine receipt message is not received in the donated time

 slot. The retransmission process is performed twice. JUs may provide an

 operator alert if, after the completion of this process, a machine receipt

 message has not been received for WILCO, HAVCO, or CANTCO response messages. 

 For those response messages that are not operator initiated, no alert shall

 be generated.

 4.1.7.7 RELAY OF RECEIPT/COMPLIANCE MESSAGES

 A terminal functioning as an active relay shall relay messages that require

 receipt/compliance, but it shall not receipt messages for which it is not the

 addressee.

 4.1.7.8 SUPPRESSION OF REDUNDANT ORIGINAL MESSAGES OR RESPONSE

 MESSAGES

 Transmission of a redundant original message or response message may be

 suppressed if the addressed unit in the original or response message becomes

 inactive prior to completion of the redundant transmissions.

###### 4.2 SYSTEM INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND NETWORK MANAGEMENT

 This technical function provides for the exchange of information required to

 establish and maintain an interface via Link 16. This information shall be

 exchanged via messages that enable network synchronization, timing, dynamic

 capacity assignments and reassignments, network control, cryptovariable

 management, designation of relays, reassignment of relays and Net Control

 Stations (NCSs), and other actions required to ensure interoperability of the

 interfacing tactical data systems (TDSs).

 The following discussion is divided into two parts: a general overview of

 the Network Management process, and detailed technical considerations and

 specific procedures. The general overview is presented first.

 4.2.1 THE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

 The responsibilities associated with the Network Management process may be

 broken into three primary activities:

 a. Network Structure Design.

 b. Resource Allocation.

 c. Network Initialization and Maintenance.

 These activities are described briefly in this section and are covered in

 greater depth beginning with paragraph 4.2.2. JUs that are equipped with

 appropriate facilities shall be appointed as Network Managers to perform

 these activities. JUs that are designated as Network Managers may be

 assigned all or part of the above activities (including Cryptonet Management)
 either for an entire network or for a subset of the network limited by the C[2]

 structure or geographic area. The personnel and equipment needed for a

 facility to support Network Management will depend both on the activities to

 be performed and on the size, complexity, and dynamics of the network. The

 degree of automation required for Network Management will also depend on

 these factors.


-----

###### Cryptonet Management is required to minimize the exposure of sensitive

 operational information; access should be based on risk and need-to-know. 

 Risk and need-to-know are the factors used to limit the adverse impact on

 operations of a known or unknown compromise and to facilitate actions to

 recover from a known compromise. Compromise of a network's information can

 result from theft or capture of a network's cryptovariable(s). Cryptonet

 Managers can limit operational impact from a known or unknown compromise by

 assigning separate cryptovariables to Participation Groups (PGs) based on

 their need-to-know and the risk of compromise of the data transferred within

 the PG.

 4.2.1.1 NETWORK STRUCTURE DESIGN

 In configuring a Link 16 network, the first step is to establish a skeletal

 structure for the network based on the community's communications and

 communications security requirements. This process involves determining

 communities of interest, i.e., Participation Groups, for each information

 exchange category and establishing connectivity within these communities.

 4.2.1.1.1 PARTICIPATION GROUPS

 The Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) network structure is organized

 around Participation Groups made up of Network PGs and Needline PGs

 (described in paragraph 4.2.3.1). A Network Manager responsible for 

 configuring the network structure shall first establish a set of

 Participation Group Communities (PGCs) fitting the communications

 requirements of the general community for which he has responsibility. To do

 so, the Network Manager must be informed as to the message types to be

 exchanged by JUs in the general community, the communications security

 requirements, and the sources and destinations (specific or general)

 associated with each message type.

 The communications security requirements of a PGC define the allowable

 message security connectivity for the PGC. The security requirements of all

 PGCs dictate to the Network Manager which PGCs can belong to the same

 cryptonet. A cryptonet is the set of all JUs holding the same cryptovariable

 for message security. In the JTIDS/MIDS system, messages can be transmitted


-----

###### in one of two security modes, the Common Variable mode or the Partitioned

 Variable mode.

 4.2.1.1.2 SECURITY MODES

 The JTIDS/MIDS system provides both transmission security (TRANSEC) and

 message security (MSEC). In the Common Variable mode there is one

 cryptovariable used for both TRANSEC and MSEC. In the Partitioned Variable

 mode there are two cryptovariables, one for TRANSEC and one for MSEC. Each

 JTIDS/MIDS net is defined by a net number and a TRANSEC cryptovariable. Each

 time slot assignment on a net can be designated to operate in the Common

 Variable or Partitioned Variable mode. In the Common Variable mode all net

 members can receive and read the messages transmitted, thereby operating as a

 single cryptonet. In the Partitioned Variable mode the nets can be divided

 into multiple cryptonets using different MSEC variables. In order to receive

 and read the messages transmitted, a JU must be a net member and a cryptonet

 member. However, in the Partitioned Variable mode any net member can relay

 any J-Series message even though the net member does not hold the same MSEC

 variable.

 4.2.1.1.3 MULTINETTING AND STACKED NETS

 When the PGCs have been established, sets of PGCs that are suitable for

 multinetting or stacked netting shall be identified to allow for multinet

 operations without loss of operationally required connectivity if multinet

 operation is necessitated by capacity demands (See paragraph 4.2.4.1.1.). A

 set of PGs may be multinetted if their associated PGCs have no JUs in common. 

 A set of PGs may be stacked if their associated PGCs have no JUs in common,

 and their capacity requirements are identical.

 4.2.1.1.4 RELAY

 Once the PGCs are established, measures shall be taken to provide for

 connectivity among the JUs in each PGC. Because of line of sight (LOS)

 limitations or enemy jamming, some JUs may not be able to communicate

 directly with other JUs in their PGC. Where direct links between all JUs in

 a PGC do not exist or are unreliable, connectivity shall be established


-----

###### through the use of relays. JUs that are suitably located during the course

 of their normal operations shall serve as relays of opportunity.

 A JU designated to relay a message shall be provided with capacity in which

 to transmit the relayed message. Three relay modes are available: Paired

 Slot Relay mode, Repromulgation Relay mode, and Addressed Relay mode. Relay

 assignments can be Unconditional or Conditional. An Unconditional Relay is

 activated upon assignment. A Conditional Relay is activated and deactivated

 automatically as a terminal function based on the location and relative

 distance of the JU from other active relays.

 a. Paired Slot Relay Mode. In the Paired Slot Relay mode, any message

 received in a given time slot block X shall be relayed in the next occurring

 time slot of an associated time slot block Y. Multiple sets of paired time

 slots may be strung together to handle multihop relays. However, the use of

 relays, particularly multihop paired slot relays, is very costly in terms of

 system capacity. Single-hop paired slot relay requires twice the time slots

 needed for the original transmissions. More generally, N-hop Paired Slot

 Relay increases the time slot requirement by a factor of N plus 1. Paired

 Slot Relay assignments may be either Conditional or Unconditional.

 b. Repromulgation Relay Mode. The Repromulgation Relay mode is an

 alternative relay mode designed to conserve capacity in a multihop relay

 environment. It is also designed to provide a way of distributing

 information in a multihop relay environment without depending on a terminal

 knowing direct or indirect connectivity, relay address, or externally

 supplied routing information. Thus, it is a distributed capability that does

 not depend on a central control function for its normal operation. It is

 suited to communications where a high throughput rate must be sustained or

 where messages have multiple destinations. Repromulgation Relay assignments

 are Unconditional only.

 Using the Repromulgation Relay mode, relay time slots are donated from the

 originating JU's time slot block. A message designated for the

 Repromulgation Relay mode must be preceded by a Repromulgation Relay message

 which must be the first message in the time slot. The Repromulgation Relay

 message will specify the number of times the message should be relayed and

 the exact delay between the receipt of the message and the relay


-----

###### transmission. This delay corresponds to the Recurrence Rate of the time slot

 block (or subblock) in which the message originated. The originating JU may

 transmit its next message in the third slot of the time slot block following

 the previous transmission.

 When the time slot requirements are driven by a throughput requirement, the

 Repromulgation Relay mode increases the time slot requirement at most by a

 factor of three, regardless of the number of relay hops required. The main

 drawback of this technique is that the first word of each message is required

 as overhead.

 c. Addressed Relay Mode. The Addressed Relay mode can be used where

 multihops are required to achieve the desired physical and functional

 connectivity. Terminals participating in communications according to

 specific needlines must be controllable not only by relay time slot

 assignments and Repromulgation Counters, but also by addressing techniques.

 The Addressed Relay mode involves transmitting the information in a time slot

 along an established route that is specified in the first message in the time

 slot. Addressed Relay mode assignments are Unconditional only.

 4.2.1.2 RESOURCE ALLOCATION

 While a JTIDS/MIDS network has a large capacity for the exchange of tactical

 information, especially when formatted messages are transmitted, the total

 capacity of a single net is finite.

 One net has a total usable capacity of 98,304 time slots during each 12.8

 minute epoch. There are 128 assignable net numbers. Each net number can be

 associated with any available TRANSEC cryptovariable. Each net is

 characterized by a net number and a TRANSEC cryptovariable. However,

 approximately 15 to 20 of these nets can operate at the same time in

 geographic proximity without excessive mutual interference. Each time slot

 block assignment on a net can be operated in the Common or Partitioned

 Variable mode. In the Common Variable mode the net TRANSEC variable is also

 used for MSEC. In the Partitioned Variable mode, a separate variable (MSEC

 variable) is used for MSEC.


-----

###### The primary task of the Network Manager is to allocate the total network

 capacity within communications security guidelines among users who have

 information to exchange. If the number of users is small, the task of

 capacity and cryptovariable allocation is relatively simple. With a large

 number of users, the task becomes more complex because user demands quickly

 reduce the remaining, available network capacity. Therefore, the Network

 Manager needs to know how many participants there will be and their security

 requirements so this information can be factored into the Network Management

 scheme.

 The task of the Cryptonet Manager is to provide sound Cryptonet Management

 practices by:

 a. Establishing procedures that are consistent with established

 Communications Security (COMSEC) doctrine to minimize the exposure of

 sensitive operational information.

 b. Establishing procedures that provide for the most effective and

 secure use of the finite number of cryptovariables that are available.

 c. Establishing procedures that establish and maintain a relationship

 of cryptovariables to cryptovariable logical labels by using the short

 titles.

 d. Establishing procedures that provide effective methods of recovery

 from a security compromise that has resulted from a loss of a cryptovariable

 such as a keyed terminal or a cryptovariable device.

 e. Establishing a method of dynamically rekeying JTIDS/MIDS terminals

 after loss, suspected loss, or a change of cryptovariables due to operational

 considerations.

 f. Providing for the partitioning of available information into

 separate cryptonets based on the operational need-to-know and risk.

 The specific resource allocation is highly dependent on the operational

 situation, the proximity of one JU to another, and the flexibility of

 sectioning various information exchanges into mutually exclusive groups. For


-----

###### example, in situations involving the exchange of Land (Ground) and Subsurface

 (Maritime) Surveillance messages, these two functions are definable as two

 multinetted PGs. In some operational situations, however, Surface (Maritime)

 forces may have to operate close to shore, making them vulnerable to attack

 by mobile artillery as well as submarines. In this situation, Surface

 (Maritime) forces will require access to Land (Ground) and Subsurface

 (Maritime) Surveillance messages.

 4.2.1.2.1 ACCESS MODES

 When the PGCs and their associated relay requirements have been determined,

 system capacity for the corresponding PG must be allocated to meet the

 established requirements. First, a preliminary choice of the access mode to

 be used must be made. The choices available include Dedicated Access mode,

 Contention Access mode, Time Slot Reallocation (TSR) Access mode, and Call-Up

 Access mode.

 a. Dedicated Access Mode. The Dedicated Access mode is the assignment

 of specific time slots to specific JUs within a PGC. JUs have unlimited

 access to their assigned time slots within the PG. The Dedicated Access mode

 has the advantage of guaranteeing that a JU has time slots available for

 transmissions and that receiving JUs have no message conflict on a time slot. 

 However, this access mode wastes capacity if message traffic is bursty, since

 only a small subset of the assigned time slots may actually be used for

 transmissions.

 b. Contention Access Mode. The Contention Access mode allows JUs in a

 PGC to compete for the available capacity of the PG by pseudorandomly

 choosing transmission time slots from a common pool according to the

 requirements of each JU. This method conserves capacity, especially when

 message traffic is bursty or is driven by response time. However, this

 method decreases the probability that any given message will reach its

 intended destination(s) due to the possibility that more than one JU within

 LOS of the receiver may choose to transmit in the same time slot.

 c. Time Slot Reallocation Access Mode. The Time Slot Reallocation

 Access mode allows JUs in a PGC to reallocate a shared pool of time slots

 periodically so that each JU assigns itself time slots according to its


-----

###### expected demand and the announced demands of other JUs. The shared pool of

 time slots assigned to and shared by a number of JUs for exchanging messages

 in a particular PGC is known as the reallocation pool. If the aggregate JU

 demand for time slots exceeds the capacity of the reallocation pool, the JUs

 assign themselves time slots in proportion to their demands, but scaled down

 by a common factor so that the total allocation is within the reallocation

 pool capacity.

 This access mode conserves capacity by allowing the reallocation pool to be

 sized according to the expected aggregate requirement rather than as the sum

 of the peak capacity requirements of all participating JUs. The reallocation

 period can be set to the expected rate of demand fluctuations with a minimum

 reallocation period of 6 seconds and a maximum reallocation period of 48

 seconds. The access mode is designed to operate in conditions of poor

 connectivity and overload, and in these conditions it will result in graceful

 degradation in the probability of successful message transmission in the case

 of time slot conflicts and subsequent reception in the case of jamming. This

 access mode is suitable for use in an environment where the available

 capacity is to be shared by a varying community of users with fluctuating

 demands.

 The first J0.7 message sent by a JU that enters a TSR Pool must occur in a

 TSR Initial Entry Access time slot, if there is no dedicated access time slot

 assignment for the PG.

 d. Call-Up Access Mode. In the Call-Up Access mode, the allocation of

 transmission time slots within the PG is dynamically controlled through the

 use of J0.6 Communications Control messages. After receipt of a J0.6

 message, the interrogated JU transmits in all of the subsequent time slots of

 the PG until the message queue for that PG is exhausted or until the JU

 reaches the designated transmission limit, at which time another JU is

 interrogated. Interrogations may be made by a centralized control (Roll Call

 mode) or by successive terminals at the end of their own transmissions (Round

 Robin mode).


-----

###### 4.2.1.2.2 CALCULATION OF PARTICIPATION GROUP TIME SLOT REQUIREMENTS

 When an access mode (or modes) for a PGC has been selected, the capacity

 requirements for the PG may be calculated. Time slot requirements are

 primarily determined by the transmit time slot requirements of the individual

 JUs in the PGC, the number of JUs in the PGC, their relative locations, the

 chosen access mode(s), the relay requirements, and the chosen acknowledgement

 protocol.

 The transmit time slot requirement of a JU is equal to either the throughput

 requirement (the number of time slots each epoch required to support the JU's

 throughput requirements for original transmissions, relay transmissions, and

 acknowledgements) or the response time requirement (the number of time slots

 each epoch required to provide the specified response time for messages to be

 transmitted by the JU in that PG), whichever number is greater.

 For the Dedicated Access mode, the PG time slot requirement is equal to the

 sum of the transmit time slot requirements of the individual JUs in the PGC. 

 For the Contention Access mode, the time slot requirement is a function of

 the JU's transmit time slot requirements, the density of the JUs, and the

 required message reception probability by specific receivers. For the Time

 Slot Reallocation Access mode, the time slot requirement is equal to the

 maximum combined requirement of the PGC including an allowance for the

 transmission of J0.7 messages and the Time Slot Reallocation initial entry

 time slot requirements which are a function of the required time for a JU to

 begin participation in the reallocation pool and the number of JUs that may

 be expected to attempt to enter a Time Slot Reallocation pool simultaneously. 

 For the Call-Up Access mode, the PG time slot requirement is the sum of the

 average throughput time slot requirements of the JUs in the PGC plus the

 number of time slots required for overhead.

 4.2.1.2.3 ASSIGNMENT OF TIME SLOT BLOCKS

 Once the time slot requirements for all PGs have been computed, the Network

 Manager may begin to allocate the system capacity. The first step in this

 process is to determine the time slot block requests for each PG. Since
 JTIDS/MIDS terminals are assigned time slot blocks of size 2[N] (0 is less than

 or equal to N is less than or equal to 15) per epoch, and since any single JU


-----

###### can accept only a limited number of block assignments, it may not be possible

 to match the exact number of time slots allocated to the PG's actual

 requirements. Therefore, it may be necessary to round off the time slot

 requests of some PGs. When time slot block requests have been determined for

 each PG, the Network Manager must assign specific time slot blocks in

 accordance with these requests.

 4.2.1.2.4 METHODS TO REDUCE RESOURCE UTILIZATION

 When JTIDS/MIDS is fully deployed, capacity requirements may exceed the

 available terminal, network or system capacities. When the sum of the time

 slot block requests for all PGs exceeds the capacity of one net, multinetting

 and stacking of PGs may be employed by the network/system manager to increase

 available capacity. If multinetting and stacking do not provide enough

 additional capacity to meet the demand, the Network Manager has several other

 options available to reduce the time slot block allocations to the various

 PGs. For a specific PG, methods for reducing capacity requirements include:

 a. Time slot reuse (assigning the same time slots to more than one JU

 in the PG).

 b. Changing the access mode.

 c. Using Packed-2 messages.

 d. Reducing the number of relay hops.

 Any of these methods may reduce the message reception probability and thus

 must be used with caution. In some cases, it may be preferable to reduce

 capacity demands by easing performance requirements, e.g., by lessening

 response time requirements.

 4.2.1.3 NETWORK INITIALIZATION AND MAINTENANCE

 The following paragraphs describe the procedures for network initialization

 and maintenance.


-----

###### 4.2.1.3.1 DYNAMIC VERSUS STATIC NETWORK MANAGEMENT

 To achieve a maximum degree of nodelessness, a JTIDS/MIDS network should

 operate with minimal intervention from Network Managers. To the maximum

 extent possible, Network Management should be carried out in advance of

 operations. Advance preparations can include determination of the PGCs,

 nets, cryptonets, capacity allocations, access modes, mission channel

 assignments, Net Time Reference (NTR), and Initial Entry JTIDS Unit (IEJU)

 assignments. Network Management performed without real-time intervention of

 a Network Manager is referred to as Static Network Management.

 Dynamic Network Management denotes real-time or nearly real-time management

 of the network by a Network Manager or Managers. Typically, Dynamic Network

 Management is executed by transmitting commands, via JTIDS/MIDS, using J0

 System Information Exchange and Network Management messages. Dynamic Network

 Management allows a rapid adjustment of the network to changing

 circumstances, but it has the disadvantage of creating communications nodes

 and increasing the opportunity for error. Some degree of Dynamic Network

 Management will probably be necessary as part of network initialization and

 maintenance activities.

 4.2.1.3.2 NETWORK INITIALIZATION AND NET ENTRY

 Network initialization activities include the establishment of time

 synchronization among all JUs in the network and the communication of network

 capacity assignments and relay assignments to participating JUs. Time

 synchronization within a net is accomplished as follows:

 a. Time Synchronization. One JU is assigned as the Network Time

 Reference (NTR) to establish system time. The NTR begins transmitting in a

 designated set of time slots known as the Net Entry time slots. Other JUs

 then join the network as operationally required by synchronizing directly or

 indirectly with the NTR. This process is known as network entry.

 b. JTIDS/MIDS Network Entry. JTIDS/MIDS Network Entry is achieved in

 two steps: Coarse Synchronization and Fine Synchronization. The process

 begins with the operator entering into the terminal an estimate of system


-----

###### time and a corresponding time uncertainty. After this, Network Entry is an

 automatic terminal function.

 The terminal begins listening for a message in the Net Entry time slots. 

 When one error-free message signal has been received, the terminal achieves a

 state of Coarse Synchronization. At this time, it is capable of receiving

 messages, but it is not permitted to transmit any message except the Round
 Trip-Timing (RTT) Interrogation.

 Fine Synchronization is achieved by further improving the JU's estimate of

 system time. This may be accomplished either in the Active mode (exchanging

 an RTT Interrogation/Reply with a JU already in the network, i.e., already

 synchronized to the NTR) or in the Passive mode (using J2 PPLI messages

 received from JUs in the network). Active main net relays, and IEJUs will

 also broadcast in the Net Entry time slots to support the entry of JUs that

 are not within LOS of the NTR.

 Network capacity assignments and relay assignments may be entered into the

 terminal either manually by the operator or automatically via Link 16

 messages. Preferably, network capacity assignments shall be issued to the

 JUs prior to their entry into the network. However, the J0.0 Initial Entry

 message shall contain the time slot assignments for certain Network PGs.

 4.2.1.3.3 NETWORK MAINTENANCE

 Network maintenance activity includes the preservation of synchronization,

 connectivity, communications security and network capacity assignments

 appropriate to the communications requirements of the network participants. 

 The activities associated with network maintenance include:

 a. The assignment of a replacement NTR if the current NTR fails or is

 destroyed.

 b. The assignment of replacement and/or additional IEJUs.

 c. The assignment and cancellation of relay responsibilities to meet

 current connectivity requirements.


-----

###### d. The assignment and cancellation of network capacity allocations to

 meet current communications requirements.

 e. The updating of the Network Management database and the

 reassignment of network capacity as subscribers enter and exit the network.

 f. The distribution and management of cryptovariables to meet

 communications requirements and communications security requirements.

 4.2.2 PLANNING AND EXECUTING NETWORK MANAGEMENT

 Two phases of Network Management must receive attention before and during

 tactical operations. The phases are:

 a. Planning for Network Management.

 b. Executing Network Management.

 Detailed discussions of each topic are presented in the sections that follow.

 4.2.2.1 PLANNING FOR NETWORK MANAGEMENT

 Two phases of planning for Network Management can be identified:

 a. Planning Network Management facilities.

 b. Planning Network Management for subscribers.

 4.2.2.1.1 PLANNING NETWORK MANAGEMENT FACILITIES

 This phase of preparation involves the acquisition of equipment and the

 training of people capable of performing Network Management. These resources

 are located at appropriate operational and organizational facilities. A

 Network Management facility is required to support a Network Manager's

 activities. Network Managers engaged in Dynamic Network Management must have

 access to the JTIDS/MIDS network through JTIDS/MIDS terminals collocated with

 the Network Management facility. Thus, such facilities must also be JUs.


-----

###### When there is more than one Network Management facility in a given network,

 the Network Managers are hierarchically organized. Each Network Manager

 performs Network Management for a segment of the network capacity. If the

 active Network Manager's facility suffers catastrophic failure, a designated

 backup facility will assume the Network Management function. If the Joint

 Operational Commander (JOC) decides to use one of the Service's facilities as

 the joint Network Manager (such as U.S. Air Force Tactical Air Control Center
 (TACC)/Message Processing Center (MPC), U.S. Marine Corps C[2] Unit, U.S. Army
 NCS, or U.S. Navy C[2] Unit), this facility is expected to provide its own

 backup facility. This implies prioritized, designated backup Network

 Managers who monitor the activity of the active Network Manager and store an

 essentially duplicate database to enable the priority backup Network Manager

 to assume Network Management functions with minimum delay. Real-time

 communications connectivity between active Network Managers and backup

 Network Managers can be through JTIDS/MIDS or other conventional means.

 4.2.2.1.2 PLANNING NETWORK MANAGEMENT FOR SUBSCRIBERS

 This phase of planning involves the initialization and maintenance of the

 network database with required data on subscribers. This database should

 include a list of subscribers and potential subscribers whose network

 capacity assignments must be managed, a compilation of cryptovariables and

 their associated cryptovariable logical labels available for use by these

 subscribers, and any capacity constraints imposed by the need to partition

 the network capacity among joint and individual service applications. In

 addition, for each subscriber, the database should include the type of unit

 and its mobility, approximate location, permanence in that location, and

 communications requirements. Communications data includes items such as PGs,

 message types and associated response times, throughput/update rates, and

 rate matching. Other needed parameters characterize the terminal's

 capability to support relay modes such as the Paired Slot Relay mode, the

 Repromulgation Relay mode, and the Addressed Relay mode.

 This database should exist with appropriate backup provisions. It should be

 maintained on a continuous basis, and it should be updated as soon as

 terminals are designated for a particular operational facility. Contingency

 plans, communications plans, and operations plans should include this type of


-----

###### information as far in advance as possible to ease the initial burden on

 Network Managers.

 4.2.2.2 EXECUTING NETWORK MANAGEMENT

 In the execution phase, Network Management functions are performed by both

 Network Manager JUs and subscriber JUs. Thus, two types of Network

 Management functions should be considered:

 a. Network Management functions executed at the Network Management

 facilities.

 b. Network Management support functions executed by the subscribers

 (including relays).

 4.2.2.2.1 FUNCTIONS EXECUTED AT THE NETWORK MANAGEMENT FACILITIES

 These facilities carry out unique Network Management tasks that cannot be

 performed by other subscribers. These tasks can include making NTR and IEJU

 assignments, the partitioning of available capacity into PGs, the

 distribution and/or assignment of cryptovariables, the determination of the

 need for relays and the designation of relay terminals. A Network Manager

 shall also dynamically respond to changes in subscriber participation,

 communications security, and relay requirements during the course of an

 operation. Appropriate Network Management messages shall be generated to

 implement the required changes.

 4.2.2.2.2 FUNCTIONS EXECUTED BY THE SUBSCRIBERS

 Network Management support includes Network Management tasks that can be

 performed by subscriber JTIDS/MIDS terminals that are not necessarily network

 managers. A JTIDS/MIDS terminal can declare itself NTR, synchronize with an

 already existing NTR, enter the network to a full participation status, exit

 the network, accept relay instructions and network capacity assignment

 instructions, abide by the protocols of the various access modes, and

 contribute to relaying based on the Conditional Relay Algorithm.


-----

###### 4.2.3 ESTABLISHMENT OF PARTICIPATION GROUPS

 The establishment of PGs shall be a responsibility of the Network Manager. 

 This establishment of PGs is the first step in a multistep process of time

 slot management which consists of allocating the available JTIDS/MIDS

 capacity to a given set or type of subscribers. The two categories of PGs

 are:

 a. Network PGs.

 b. Needline PGs.

 Within each category of PG, there may be numerous specific PGs. Each

 subscriber may participate in either or both PG categories, but a subscriber

 is limited by terminal implementation on the exact number of PGs in which he

 may participate.

 4.2.3.1 NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUPS AND NEEDLINE PARTICIPATION GROUPS

 A Network PG is characterized by a list of applicable messages used to

 support an agreed upon technical function without regard to subscriber

 identities. A Needline PG is characterized by a list of netted subscribers

 compiled without regard to the specific messages they exchange with each

 other.

 JTIDS/MIDS network capacity must first be allocated among Network PGs based

 on the combined needs of the users, the priority of those needs, and the

 characteristics of the JTIDS/MIDS technical functions. This allocation shall

 be relatively fixed; it is based on the general need to maintain network

 operation and essential connectivity. The remainder of the allocation shall

 be flexible to permit adaptation to changing operational needs and various

 levels of network loading. This scheme provides for a single net and

 cryptonet in situations demanding total interoperability. It also provides

 for multinets, multiple cryptonets, and stacked nets where the network

 loading, security, and functional, mission, or tactical operation

 connectivity requirements make such network organization desirable.


-----

###### After an initial portion of the JTIDS/MIDS network capacity is allocated to

 required joint Network PGs, the remaining capacity can be allocated among

 Service-unique Network PGs or Needline PGs. A Needline PG is characterized

 by the following parameters: source user military identification,

 destination user military identification, bits per message, number of

 messages each peak period, end-to-end response time, and the needline

 priority with respect to the source.

 The capacity associated with a Needline PG is that required to support a

 needline from a single source to one or more destinations which are to

 receive the same messages.

 As mentioned above, the distinction between a Network PG and a Needline PG is

 that Network PGs allow transmission of specific message labels and sub-labels

 by/to any subscriber, and Needline PGs allow transmission of any message

 labels and sublabels by/to a specific set of subscribers. By assignment of

 time slots, the Network Manager may establish a Network PG which allows

 transmission of specific message labels and sublabels by/to a specific set of

 subscribers.

 The specific PGs to be established are determined by the participants in the

 various communities of interest that exist among participants, minimum

 implementation requirements, response time and throughput requirements for

 each message label or needline, and allowed access modes and other

 information exchange requirements (See paragraph 4.2.3.10). These technical

 considerations are described in the following paragraphs.

 Joint Network PGs that have been defined for Link 16 are described in

 paragraph 4.2.3.10. No joint Needline PGs have been identified; however, the

 U.S. Army has defined numerous Needline PGs for intra-Service use.

 Once PGs are established, they must be supported by the subscribers. A JU

 must organize and execute its transmissions according to the PG assignments

 made to it. The PG assignments may be predefined in the terminal database,

 be preloaded into the terminal as initialization input, vary dynamically

 through control inputs received during terminal operation via the host

 platform, or they may vary dynamically by radioed Network Management

 messages. Since the Link 16 time slot assignment messages cannot associate


-----

###### specific PG numbers with message labels and sublabels which characterize the

 PG, this correspondence must be previously agreed upon. Similarly, with

 Needline PGs, a Needline PG number must be preassigned during initialization

 or by operations order to associate a source JU with allowed destination JUs.

 The rudimentary assignments necessary for subscriber network entry, position

 location, and Network Management support functions must be known and

 initialized as described herein.

 4.2.3.2 INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS

 Information exchange requirements are determined from the mission of the

 subscribers. Only a subset of these requirements need be given to the

 Network Manager as an input to the Network Management database. The

 parameters of the information exchange requirements may vary from user to

 user. To avoid confusion and misinterpretation of these parameters, the

 Network Manager may establish a standard set of parameters which he shall

 accept from subscribers. Operational requirements may dictate the use of

 nonstandard parameters. The following parameters are most useful to the

 Network Manager:

 a. PG types.

 b. Labels and sublabels of messages per PG type.

 c. Length of messages, in bits.

 d. Number of messages per unit time per label/sublabel per PG type.

 e. End-to-end response time per message label/sublabel per PG.

 f. The connectivity requirements of the PGCs using each PG type.

 g. Security requirements of the PGCs using each PG type.

 If the PG types are not specified by the potential subscriber or his

 proponent, the Network Manager shall use the JTIDS TIDP for guidance. This

 document provides a set of Network PGs that have been agreed upon jointly.


-----

###### Message labels and sublabels are defined for each Link 16 message, and

 terminal's response times and update rates are given along with T/R rules to

 facilitate the derivation of required throughput and end-to-end response

 times. If the message labels and sublabels do not match the guidance

 outlined herein, the Network Manager must determine the PG categories and

 types within categories based upon the given subscriber's missions and other

 subscribers associated with his missions. The Network Manager shall align

 the throughput/response time requirements to minimize the total network

 capacity utilization.

 Most of the data needed to make capacity estimates are available in the form

 of force structure, intelligence estimates, and other operational planning

 information. Once the gross capacity estimates have been made for each

 Network PG, they should be refined into maximum, average, and minimum loading

 estimates. Based on these estimates and communications security

 requirements, determinations can be made regarding such functions as access

 mode, time slot reuse, multiple cryptonetting, multinetting, and stacked

 netting. The specific arrangement will be somewhat dependent on the

 operational situation and the feasibility of partitioning various information

 exchange requirements into PGCs.

 4.2.3.3 MINIMUM IMPLEMENTATION

 Minimum implementation requirements are defined in Appendix A to this volume. 

 Of importance to the task of Network Management is the fact that Link 16

 participation requires that specific technical functions be implemented by

 all JUs on the network. The requirements of minimum implementation will, by

 necessity, use a portion of the total JTIDS/MIDS network capacity.

 4.2.3.4 RESPONSE TIME

 JTIDS/MIDS capacity assignments may be driven by response time requirements.

 Response time is a term used to characterize delay performance of a system

 given a set of inputs or stimuli. Response time is therefore dependent on

 the specific messages entering the system and the "extent of the system." 

 The "extent of the system" may include the JU, or may encompass the

 originator and recipient (end-to-end process) including both people and

 equipment. Response times are defined below:


-----

###### a. JU Response Time. The time from new information availability at

 the JU to the transmission of the information on the link. This time is

 defined for each message in Table 4.1-3.

 b. Terminal Response Time. The time from new information availability

 at the terminal to the transmission of the information on the link. The JU

 Response Time is made up of the Terminal Response Time and the platform

 system response time. For purposes of platform system implementation, the

 Terminal Response Time begins when the data are available at the output

 interface of the platform system and ends when the message signal has been

 emitted on the source antenna. This time can be divided into necessary

 processing time and time to availability of the next transmission time slot. 

 The necessary processing time is 100 msec (approximately 13 time slots). The

 time to the availability of the next transmission time slot is a function of

 Network Management decisions. The access rate and access mode are principal

 determining factors.

 c. End-to-End Response Time. The time from new information

 availability at the source JU to the reception of the message at the

 destination JU.

 In terms of operational requirements, the End-to-End Response Time is the

 item of concern. This response time is made up of the JU Response Time and

 the transmission time. Transmission time varies with the transmission path

 which, to the extent it is controllable, depends on Network Management

 decisions. The number of relays and the offset delay at each relay unit are

 the principal determining factors.

 The Network Manager must consider the delays resulting from access rate,

 access mode, and relay delay in arriving at an End-to-End Response Time that

 is operationally acceptable. The Network Manager uses Terminal Response Time

 to estimate the time slot capacity (time slots per second) needed to meet

 End-to-End Response Time requirements.

 4.2.3.5 THROUGHPUT

 Assignment of the JTIDS/MIDS network capacity may be driven by throughput

 requirements. Throughput is a general term used to characterize the load


-----

###### performance of a system, given a set of inputs or stimuli. Throughput

 requirements are therefore dependent on the length of specific messages

 entering the system and the frequency with which these messages are

 exchanged.

 For periodic messages, such as surveillance track reports, the message

 frequency is the product of the total number of tracks to be exchanged per

 unit of time and the update rate of a track during the same unit of time. 

 For nonperiodic messages, such as control commands or requests for support,

 the subscriber or his proponents must provide an estimate of frequency of

 given messages based upon scenarios or experience. The throughput

 requirement may then be estimated from the product of the average message

 length and the message frequency.

 The throughput requirement should also be reduced to units of time slots per

 second. The assignment of time slots then becomes dependent on whether

 throughput or response time requires more capacity. Message update rates are

 specified in Table 4.1-3 and in the T/R rules for each message.

 4.2.3.6 RATE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS

 When a PG is established for interconnection with nonJTIDS/MIDS nets or for

 interfacing certain types of platform systems, the requirement for rate

 matching may arise. Rate matching is required when the following two

 conditions exist simultaneously. The first is that the size of the PG time

 slot assignment must match very closely an arbitrary value that cannot be

 matched by a single time slot block. The second is that the interval between

 the time slots must be nearly uniform. The need for a uniform interval

 arises when a PG containing multiple time slot blocks of different Recurrence

 Rate Numbers must be interfaced through a buffer with a channel having a

 uniform rate. The size of the buffer determines the maximum interval between

 the time slots in the PG. By suitably assigning multiple time slot blocks of

 the same Recurrence Rate Number, a near match to both requirements can be

 made. In general, the smaller the Recurrence Rate Number used, the closer

 the match will be (at the expense of increased fragmentation of the

 assignable capacity).


-----

###### 4.2.3.7 TRANSMIT ACCESS MODES

 The transmit access modes identify the algorithms (rules and procedures) used

 by a JU in scheduling its transmissions. The scheduling of transmissions

 involves the assignment of the next available time slot, as constrained by

 the access mode, to the transmission of the message(s) waiting in queue.

 Four access modes are defined: Dedicated Access mode, Contention Access

 mode, Time Slot Reallocation Access mode, and Call-Up Access mode. Network

 loading and the communications mode in use will have a bearing on which

 transmit access mode is selected. The transmit access modes are assigned as

 a part of the time slot block assignments for each PG.

 4.2.3.7.1 DEDICATED ACCESS MODE

 Dedicated Access mode time slot assignments are used to increase the

 probability of receipt of a transmitted message. When there are sufficient

 time slots available in the network capacity to simultaneously satisfy the

 information exchange requirements of each JU, the Dedicated Access mode may

 be used. As the demand for time slots increases, a mixture of Dedicated

 Access mode and the other two modes will be required to provide each JU with

 sufficient transmission opportunities. Time slots used for the Dedicated

 Access mode are assigned to a terminal for its use in transmitting messages. 

 Also, as in the case of the acknowledgement function, a Dedicated Access mode

 time slot can be assigned temporarily to another terminal for its use in

 transmitting a message. Normally one terminal participating in an organized

 JTIDS/MIDS net transmits a message in a time slot assigned as a dedicated

 access slot; however, Dedicated Access mode time slots may be reused by JUs

 either beyond or within LOS of each other, depending on the communications

 performance requirements of the involved JUs.

 4.2.3.7.2 TIME SLOT REUSE IN THE DEDICATED ACCESS MODE

 In non-LOS situations, a Network Manager may assign the same dedicated access

 time slot blocks to JUs that do not directly communicate with one another or

 do not communicate with a common third JU using these assignments. 

 Propagational attenuation should be determined to be sufficient to preclude

 possible transmission capture between JUs that are not interoperating.


-----

###### 4.2.3.7.3 CONTENTION ACCESS MODE

 When there are JUs demanding more time slots than are available in the

 JTIDS/MIDS network capacity, the Contention Access mode can be selected by

 the Network Manager. Time slots assigned for the Contention Access mode form

 a pool that is shared by a community of terminals for transmitting and

 receiving messages. In this mode, more than one terminal can transmit

 messages in any specified time slot. If two or more transmissions occur in

 the same time slot, a receiving terminal will lock onto the message from the

 closest transmitting terminal, which may or may not be the message it needs. 

 The transmission with the earliest time of arrival (TOA) will be processed by

 the receiving terminal.

 The Contention Access mode can be used only in Communications Mode 1

 (wideband transmissions). Time slots are assignable to a particular pool for

 the Contention Access mode and are used by a terminal to transmit messages

 belonging to that pool. Transmission time slots belonging to the pool are

 allowed at an average rate of one transmission per time interval. This

 transmission slot is selected from all assigned slots that occur during the

 time interval in a manner that is pseudorandom with respect to the selection

 process at all other terminals.

 4.2.3.7.4 TIME SLOT REALLOCATION ACCESS MODE

 This access mode can be selected by the Network Manager when the demand for

 time slots using dedicated assignments exceeds supply. This mode is useful

 when user numbers and demands cannot be predicted at initialization and

 demands may fluctuate with changes in Reporting Responsibility, for example.

 This access mode allows the sharing of a specified pool of time slots,

 referred to as a reallocation pool, with other participating terminals to

 exchange messages other than voice. A JU determines its time slot

 requirements for each interval referred to as a reallocation period, and

 announces the percentage of the reallocation pool's time slots that it

 desires to use during the next reallocation period in a time slot

 reallocation message. A JU also repeats, in the same message, the

 requirements of any JUs previously received in a process known as mutual

 dissemination.


-----

###### A JU that has implemented Time Slot Reallocation will be able to operate

 simultaneously in at least two reallocation pools. Each reallocation pool is

 associated with only one Network PG and time slots in that pool may be used

 only for messages from that Network PG. More than one reallocation pool may

 be operated in a single PG. However, in a single PG, no JU may transmit in

 more than one reallocation pool. A reallocation pool must be specified in no

 more than 3 time slot blocks.

 JUs allocate capacity to themselves according to their own demands and those

 heard from the other community members. JUs scale their demands so that the

 total scaled demand is within the pool capacity. JUs select time slots on a

 pseudo-random basis, avoiding time slots that they calculate have been

 allocated to JUs that have a higher priority in the selection sequence. The

 selection sequence is based on the number of JU demands received by a given

 JU, either directly, by relay, or by mutual dissemination. The JU hearing

 the lowest number of demand reports from other terminals selects time slots

 first and so on, ties being broken by Table Position Number and, if none, by

 Source Track Number. Thus the Network Manager has no involvement in the time

 slot selection ordering, either dynamically or at initialization. This

 combination of pseudo-random selection and ordering by receive count ensures

 that in very poor connectivity the access method degrades gracefully. In

 moderate connectivity a small amount of time slot reuse may occur.

 4.2.3.7.5 TIME SLOT REUSE IN THE TIME SLOT REALLOCATION ACCESS MODE

 The Time Slot Reallocation Access mode is designed to prevent time slot reuse

 by uniformly scaling down JU capacity allocations in overload conditions. 

 Some reuse may occur in conditions of poor connectivity. As an

 initialization option, Network Designers may limit the dissemination of the

 demand information deliberately so that reuse can occur among widely

 separated JUs. This is done by setting the maximum dissemination hops

 parameter to the required number of repetitions of demand information.

 4.2.3.7.6 TIME SLOT REALLOCATION INITIAL ENTRY

 Each JU that participates in a PG using the Time Slot Reallocation Access

 mode must initially transmit the J0.7 Time Slot Reallocation message in a

 Dedicated Access time slot or, if there is no Dedicated Access mode time slot


-----

###### assignment for the JU, in one of the initial entry time slots. Initial entry

 time slot assignments are basically dedicated access mode assignments with

 time slot reuse. A JU that has not joined the reallocation pool uses a time

 slot from one of these assignments to announce the percentage of the

 reallocation pool's time slots it desires to use during the next reallocation

 period. JUs that have a time slot assignment using Dedicated Access mode in

 the PG must use that assignment for this message transmission and do not need

 an initial entry time slot assignment.

 4.2.3.7.7 TIME SLOT REUSE OF THE TIME SLOT REALLOCATION INITIAL ENTRY

 TIME SLOTS

 A Network Manager can limit time slot reuse of the Time Slot Reallocation

 Initial Entry time slot assignments by giving JUs Dedicated Access mode

 assignments. However, in situations of limited net capacity, initial entry

 time slots can be shared by all JUs in an assignment with this access mode. 

 Since these initial entry time slots are used only to enter the reallocation

 pool, there is a small probability of use by more than one JU in a single

 time slot. The Network Manager assigns initial entry time slots to meet the

 response time requirement for JUs entering a reallocation pool.

 4.2.3.7.8 CALL-UP ACCESS MODE

 In the Call-Up Access mode, information exchange is controlled in the Roll

 Call or Round Robin modes. When these modes are implemented by the terminals

 of the participating JUs, the PG time slot blocks are assigned in the

 Dedicated Access mode. The Roll Call mode is controlled by a Network Manager

 who has been assigned this specific responsibility. The J0.6 message is used

 to initiate information exchange by a specific JU and is used by the JU to

 terminate the exchange. The Round Robin mode requires the assignment of a

 sequential position to each JU for information exchange. It is also

 controlled by the J0.6 message.

 Both of the Call-Up Access modes have the characteristic that, within a fixed

 assignment of time slot blocks, the response time automatically increases

 with increasing traffic loads and decreases with decreasing traffic loads. 

 The platform systems can control the response time by controlling the amount

 of information that is exchanged. Because of the role of the platform system


-----

###### in controlling the characteristics of the information exchange, the Call-Up

 Access modes should be used only when all participating JUs in the PGC have

 the requisite capability.

 The capacity that must to be allocated to a PG that uses the Call-Up Access

 mode is determined in the same way as for any other PG using a Dedicated

 Access mode.

 4.2.3.7.9 RECEIVE ASSIGNMENTS

 Terminals shall receive messages as follows:

 a. In all time slots that are assigned specifically as receive slots,

 on the nets specified in the assignments.

 b. In all assigned transmit and paired relay transmit time slots that

 are not used by the terminal for its own transmissions, on the nets specified

 for the transmit time slots.

 c. In all time slots that have not been assigned specifically as

 either receive or transmit time slots, on the Initial Entry Network PG net.

 d. During those time slots that are specified for message

 acknowledgements, even when such messages requiring acknowledgement are not

 addressed to the terminal.

 The Network PG to which a time slot is assigned shall not be used as a

 criterion for rejecting a received message.

 4.2.3.8 PARTICIPATION GROUPS ON MULTINETS

 JTIDS/MIDS capacity on a single net is limited to 128 time slots per second.

 Therefore, no PG may be larger than 128 time slots per second. When the

 throughput or response time requirements exceed the available capacity of a

 single net, a PG may be assigned blocks of time slots on other nets. The

 Network Manager must arrange the blocks from other nets so that minimum

 conflict (overlap) results if users require interoperability on several PGs. 

 A multinetted PG may have some time slot blocks on one net and other time


-----

###### slot blocks on another net, provided that no time slot within a PG occurs

 simultaneously with another time slot in the same PG.

 4.2.3.9 MESSAGES USED IN ASSIGNING PARTICIPATION GROUPS

 The J0.3 Time Slot Assignment message is used to associate blocks of time

 slots and their associated cryptovariables with a specific PG number. The

 J0.7 message is used to request time slots within PGs that contain time slot

 reallocation pools.

###### (Network PG numbers not listed above are currently undefined but may be

 specified for use in tactical communications plan(s) in accordance with

 interface operating procedures.)

 Participation in a Network PG is the organization and execution of the

 transmission of messages according to message label and sublabel as described

 in the JTIDS/MIDS Class 2 System Segment Specification. The host TDS will

 normally specify in which Network PG a message is to be transmitted. 

 However, for the guidance of network designers and the Network Manager, a

 standard Network PG and other applicable Network PGs are identified for each

 message in Table 4.2-1. Not all JUs will be able to exchange the complete

 list of messages shown, and some JUs may exchange messages in a Network PG

 other than shown in the Table. Nevertheless, the guidance provided by Table

 4.2-1 should provide a firm basis upon which the Network Manager can

 determine allocations of transmission capability, relay capabilities or

 cryptographic assignments in the selected functional area(s). In addition,

 in the absence of different instructions from the host TDS, some terminals

 will transmit in accordance with the message to standard Network PG

 applicability given in Table 4.2-1.

###### 4.2.3.10.1 INITIAL ENTRY NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUP

 The first time slot of every 12-second interval is reserved for the

 transmission and reception of the J0.0 message to support system-wide initial

 entry. The time slots that satisfy this criterion define the Initial Entry

 Network PG, which is a fixed assignment shared by all terminals. The fixed

 block assignments are time slots (512 x N) of Set A, where N is equal to

 integers 0 through 63. This corresponds to the assignment of Time Slot 0, Set

 A, with the Recurrence Rate Number equal to 6, and a Net Number equal to 0.

 4.2.3.10.2 ROUND-TRIP-TIMING NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUP

 A terminal can accept and use one or more blocks of time slots for

 transmitting RTT Interrogations and Replies. This Network PG may be used for

 either RTT-A Interrogations in a Dedicated Access mode or RTT-B

 Interrogations in a Contention Access mode, or time slots may be assigned

 within the Network PG for each type. The rate at which RTT Interrogations

 are transmitted conforms to the requirements for achieving and maintaining

 Fine Synchronization. These requirements are described in the JTIDS/MIDS

 Technical Description, Section 3.0 Terms and Definitions.

 4.2.3.10.3 NETWORK MANAGEMENT NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUP

 A terminal can accept and use one or more blocks of time slots for

 transmitting J0 messages. This Network PG may be used for all J0 messages,

 except for the J0.0 and J0.2 Network Time Update message, in any access mode

 assigned. J2 messages may be transmitted in a Dedicated Access mode in time

 slots of this Network PG when there are no J0 messages to be transmitted.

 4.2.3.10.4 PRECISE PARTICIPANT LOCATION AND IDENTIFICATION AND STATUS

 NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUP

 A terminal can accept and use one or more blocks of time slots for

 transmitting J2 messages in the access mode specified for the transmission. 

 A terminal can operate with three specified groups referred to as the Special

 Group (Group A), the Common Group (Group B), and the Joint Net. The

 terminal always transmits its J2 messages in Group B and the Joint Net

 (except when transmitting Conditional Radio Silence as specified below) at


-----

###### the specified access rate and mode. The terminal also transmits its J2

 messages in Group A, at the specified rate, as follows: (1) when so

 commanded through the subscriber interface, (2) when it is an active,

 unconditional relay or an active conditional relay for the main net, voice

 channel, or control channel relay function, (3) just before it goes to the

 Conditional Radio Silence mode, or (4) when the host aircraft has set the

 Flight Leader Indicator in its PPLI message. The terminal shall set the

 Flight Leader Indicator as directed by the subscriber interface. The

 terminal shall only transmit Conditional Radio Silence in one NPG. If a

 transmit slot is not available in Group A, it will then go to Group B. If a

 transmit slot is not available in Group B, it will then go to the Joint Net. 

 The J13 Platform and System Status messages may be transmitted in the same

 time slot as J2 messages. Only J2 and J13 messages shall be transmitted in

 these slots at the specified rate except when in Test Mode 1. When in Test

 Mode 1, the terminal shall transmit a J0.1 Test message in place of the J2

 message in all slots in which it would normally transmit a J2 message.

 4.2.3.10.5 SURVEILLANCE NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUP

 A terminal can accept and use one or more blocks of time slots for

 transmitting surveillance data in the access mode specified for the
 transmission. Each group of C[2] JUs that are to participate in a single

 Surveillance Network PG are to be assigned time slot blocks on a net that

 supports the Surveillance Network PG.

 4.2.3.10.6 MISSION MANAGEMENT/WEAPONS COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT

 NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUP

 A terminal can accept and use one or more blocks of time slots for

 transmitting the Mission Management and the Weapons Coordination and

 Management messages in the access mode specified for the transmission. Some

 or all of the time slots in this Network PG can be assigned in the Paired

 Slot Relay mode, and the J0.5 Repromulgation Relay message can be used with

 the messages in this Network PG.


-----

###### 4.2.3.10.7 CONTROL NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUPS

 A terminal can accept and use one or more blocks of time slots for

 transmission of Control information. When the net number is not specified,

 the block assignment establishes a set of subscriber-selectable channels

 (stacked net). The terminal enables the subscriber to select a net number

 from 0 through 126 as a channel. Selection of net number 127 by the

 subscriber indicates that no channel is in effect for that terminal in that

 control group. It is possible to assign separate cryptovariables to subsets

 of these stacked nets.

 A specific Control Network PG is assigned to limited sets of JUs for specific

 tactical operations. The time slot assignments for each PG may be subdivided

 into subsets of slots assigned to each participant in the Dedicated Access

 mode, assigned in the Contention Access mode, or assigned in the Time Slot

 Reallocation Access mode.

 The terminal is also capable of accepting blocks of time slots for control

 with a net number assigned. In this case, the terminal shall use these time

 slots on the specified net, instead of the applicable common group of time

 slots, when that net number is selected as a channel using the selector for

 the applicable common group.

 4.2.3.10.8 VOICE

 A terminal can accept and use one or more blocks of time slots for voice

 transmission. The terminal is capable of accepting two common groups of time

 slots for voice. They are designated Voice Group A and Voice Group B. The

 net number is not assigned. In this case, for each voice group, the terminal

 enables the subscriber to select a net number (0 through 126) as the channel. 

 Selection of net number 127 by the subscriber indicates that no channel is in

 effect for that terminal in that voice group. Multiple subscribers may

 select the same voice channel, as determined by the communication

 requirements. It is possible to assign separate cryptovariables to subsets

 of these stacked nets.

 The terminal is also capable of accepting blocks of time slots for voice

 where the net number is assigned. In this case, the terminal shall use these


-----

###### time slots on the specified net, instead of the applicable common group of

 time slots, when that net number is selected as a channel using the selector

 for the applicable common group.

 The terminal can utilize each of the time slot blocks to transmit digitized

 voice data. Voice can be transmitted using either nonerror-coded free text

 messages or error-coded free text messages as specified during

 initialization, depending on the voice data rate. The terminal determines

 the specific message type to be used depending on the voice group block

 assignment slot type, the Recurrence Rate, and the error coding option. 

 Voice messages shall normally be handled as nonerror-coded free text

 messages.

 4.2.3.10.9 PARTICIPATION GROUPS FOR DISTRIBUTED NETWORK MANAGEMENT

 The U.S. Army terminal can accept and use time slot assignments in this

 Participation Group to conduct intra-Army communications. Net management

 messages to establish, maintain, and report connectivity among community

 members will be transmitted in the broadcast mode in this Participation

 Group.

 4.2.3.10.10 PARTICIPATION GROUP FOR RESIDUAL MESSAGES

 A terminal can accept and use time slots in this Participation Group for

 transmission of messages for which no specific Participation Group has been

 defined.

 4.2.3.10.11 PARTICIPATION GROUPS FOR AN IJMS INTERFACE

 Terminals with a bilingual capability can accept and use time slots in these

 two Participation Groups. These are used by JUs participating in an

 interface with terminals that implement the Interim JTIDS/MIDS Message

 Specification (IJMS).


-----

###### 4.2.3.10.12 PARTICIPATION GROUPS FOR JTIDS UNITS PARTICIPATING IN NET

 CONTROL STATION COMMUNITIES

 JUs participating in a given NCS community must be capable of participating

 in additional Net Management related Needline PGs. These Needline PGs are

 required to provide capacity for solicitation of new entrants into the

 community, initialization of Net Control, and connectivity information. 

 These Net Management related Needline PGs are described in the following

 subparagraphs.

 a. Net Status Needline Participation Group. A terminal can accept and

 use one block of time slots for transmitting and receiving J1.4 Communicant

 Status messages. The terminal transmits its J1.4 message in dedicated time

 slots, according to the Net Number, Control Net Entry and Time Slot Offset,

 Control Net Entry assigned to it by the J1.5 Net Control Initialization

 message. The terminal receives the J1.4 message of other JUs participating

 in NCS communities in all other time slots given by the Overall Recurrence

 Rate, Net Status Participation Group value which is also provided in the J1.5

 message. By assigning a different Time Slot Number, Net Status Participation

 Group value and Time Slot Set, Net Status Participation Group value to each

 JU in the NCS community, the NCS insures that each participating JU has the

 opportunity to transmit its J1.4 message without interfering with other

 participating JUs, exactly once every cycle determined by the Recurrence

 Rate, Net Status Participation Group value.

 The J1.4 messages will be reported periodically in the Net Status Needline

 Participation Group. The following messages will also be allowed in this

 Needline Participation Group (pre-empting the J1.4 messages):

 (1) The J2.5 Land (Ground) Point PPLI message, reported

 periodically using the ratio of one PPLI message to every 10(5-20, 1) J1.4

 messages.

 (2) A J1.1 Connectivity Status message, relayed from a JU

 wishing to enter the NCS community.

 (3) A J0.6 message, initiated when a JU determines a Needline PG

 inadequacy or failure that must be reported to the NCS.


-----

###### b. Relaying of Net Status Needline Participation Group Messages to the

 Net Control Station. In NCS communities all messages reported in the Net

 Status Needline PG must be received by the NCS. This enables the NCS to

 monitor the status of the nets under its control, verify that essential

 connectivity is preserved and adapt to dynamic changes in connectivity. For

 JUs within LOS of the NCS, the Net Status Needline PG information is received

 directly. For each JU beyond LOS of the NCS, the NCS must provide a relay

 for the original Net Status Needline PG information. No additional

 assignments are necessary for the JUs originating the messages in the Net

 Status Needline PG. However, to support this relaying, the NCS establishes a

 route using the Paired Slot Relay mode. This enables all messages reported

 by JUs participating in the Net Status Needline PG to arrive at the NCS.

 c. Net Control Needline Participation Groups. In NCS communities a

 terminal can accept and use one block of time slots for receiving messages

 from its division NCS as identified by the Unit Designator. These messages

 include the J0.1 messages, the J0.3 messages, the J0.4 Radio Relay Control

 messages, the J1.5 messages, the J1.6 Needline Participation Group Assignment

 messages and the J8.0 Unit Designator messages. The Net Control Needline PG

 is assigned to each participating JU using the J1.5 message.

 d. Net Control Entry Needline Participation Group. In NCS communities

 a terminal can accept and use one block of time slots for receiving J1.1

 Connectivity Status messages from JUs seeking to reach the NCS as new

 entrants to the NCS community. The time slot block specifications for new

 entrants are provided in the J1.4 message. The information broadcast in the

 J1.4 message is established in either of two ways. The NCS has the option of

 allowing all JUs to use a database definable default parameter called the Net

 Control Entry Time Slot Offset, which is common to all JUs participating in

 an NCS community, or the NCS may deviate from a fixed offset by assigning the

 Net Control Entry time slot block information directly in the J1.5 message. 

 The JU under control will transmit this information to potentially new

 entrant JUs in the J1.4 message. The Net Control Entry Time Slot Offset

 value provides the difference in time slots between the time slot number in

 which the JU transmits a message in the Net Status Needline PG and the time

 slot number in which the JU under control is ready to receive a J1.1 message

 from a new entrant JU. A new entrant JU processes the J1.4 message of the


-----

###### controlled JU to determine which option is to be used and thus in which time

 slot its J1.1 message is expected to be received.

 4.2.3.10.13 NONC[2] JU-TO-NONC[2] JU NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUPS

 A terminal can accept and use one or more blocks of time slots for the
 exchange of data among a group of nonC[2] JUs. Operation is normally in a

 multinet or stacked net structure. The time slot assignments for the PGs may

 be subdivided into subsets of slots assigned to each participant of a stacked

 net in the Dedicated Access, Contention Access, or Time Slot Reallocation
 modes. Joint networks may operate a combination of access modes (some nonC[2]
 JUs transmitting in the Dedicated Access mode and some nonC[2] JUs transmitting
 in the Contention Access mode and some nonC[2] JUs transmitting in the Time Slot
 Reallocation mode). If Control NPG and/or NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPG A time
 slots are made available in the network design, all nonC[2] JUs on a given
 mission will exchange data using these time slots. The use of NonC[2] JU-to NonC[2] JU NPG B does not negate or otherwise impact the use of Control NPG and
 NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPG A for the exchange of flight data.

 4.2.3.10.14 JOINT ENGAGEMENT COORDINATION NETWORK PARTICIPATION GROUP

 A terminal can accept and use one or more blocks of time slots for

 transmitting the Engagement Coordination message as well as related

 Surveillance, Information Management, and Weapons Coordination and Management

 data in the access mode specified for the transmission. The NPG may be used

 for engagement coordination among systems in a multi-net environment.

 4.2.4 CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS

 4.2.4.1 GENERAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS

 In most of the projected scenarios that include the future use of JTIDS/MIDS,

 a single 98,304-time-slots-per-epoch net will not provide sufficient capacity

 to meet user requirements for information exchange. The JTIDS/MIDS

 architecture provides for the simultaneous operation of 128 single nets per

 TRANSEC variable, but it has been estimated that only about 15 to 20 nets can

 operate at any one time in a given geographical area without excessive mutual

 interference.


-----

###### Security factors that affect JTIDS/MIDS capacity are:

 a. Cryptonet size limitations.

 b. Limiting access on the basis of need-to-know.

 c. Information sensitivity, e.g., long-term vs short-term information,

 special sources.

 An additional capacity constraint also arises. Any given terminal can handle

 only an assignment of a limited number of time slot blocks, as shown in Table

 4.2-2. Because of these limitations, a terminal may not be able to

 participate in all PGs if the capacity of the PG is fragmented among several

 time slot blocks. The optimum number of time slot blocks to be assigned

 depends on the time slot block size, required capacity, required

 fragmentation, and a terminal's capability to accept additional time slot

 blocks.

 Another capacity constraint is the number of cryptovariables a terminal can

 use concurrently. This is fixed for each terminal as shown in Table 4.2-2. 

 If "over-the-air rekeying" is employed this permits a terminal to be given

 new cryptovariables, but it does not increase the terminal's real-time

 concurrent use of this fixed number of cryptovariables.

###### 4.2.4.1.1 MULTINET OPERATIONS

 JTIDS/MIDS provides for multinet operations in which two or more JUs can

 transmit in the same time slot on different nets to increase communications

 capacity. A multinet operation can be conducted only in Communications Mode

 1 (wideband) where the mutual interference caused by simultaneous

 transmissions can be tolerated by the inherent jamming protection offered by

 this mode. It must be noted, however, that multinet operation precludes

 interoperability and connectivity among users who operate simultaneously on

 different nets. Because of this, multinetting should be used only when the

 time slot blocks associated with the particular functions to be accommodated

 (e.g., Control Network PGs) can be assigned to exclusive communities of JUs

 performing functions on an organizational basis. JUs operating in one net

 normally would not need to participate in another net.

 In a multinet structure, all nets are mutually synchronized so that each time

 slot of each net is coincident in time with the corresponding time slot of

 every other net. Only one unit is designated as the NTR at any given time,

 establishing one system time for all synchronized nets. A JU can participate

 in several nets on a time-slot-to-time-slot basis, depending on its

 assignment.

 Multinetting is the simultaneous use of specific blocks of time slots on

 different nets of a JTIDS/MIDS network independently by different sets of

 users. Connectivity is not maintained among all users of these time slots.

 A stacked net operation is the coordinated use of simultaneous blocks of time

 slots. These blocks of time slots are characterized by the same Set Number,

 Initial Slot Number (ISN), and Recurrence Rates, but different net numbers

 and/or cryptovariables. Time slot blocks may be changed by switch action to

 select a desired net number.

 4.2.4.1.2 RELAY CAPACITY

 Relay capability is required for subscribers who must communicate with other

 subscribers beyond LOS. The relay capacity requirement is directly

 proportional to the number of relays that are required to reach the

 destination. The proportionality constraint depends upon the access mode. 


-----

###### The relay capacity requirement may also depend on the location of the relay. 

 A more judiciously positioned relay may require more relay capacity since it

 will likely be selected to support more subscribers with relay requirements.

 To properly estimate the required relay capacity at a particular relay

 terminal, the Network Manager must sum the relay requirements of each PG that

 will require the support of the particular relay. In the Paired Slot Relay

 mode, the Network Manager shall assign the relay receive time slots and the

 relay transmit time slots to each designated relay. In the Repromulgation or

 Addressed Relay mode, the Network Manager shall assign all of the relay

 transmission capacity to the message originator who will then donate time

 slots to potential relays. Potential relays and destinations must be

 assigned the same time slots as receive time slots.

 Whenever a receive assignment is issued for time slots that will contain

 relayed messages in the Partitioned Variable mode, the Network Manager must

 inform the recipient of the total relay delay and original net number. This

 is not required for messages transmitted in the Common Variable mode.

 4.2.4.1.3 MESSAGES USED TO SUPPORT CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS

 The J0.0 message provides the basic, minimum, mission independent capacity to

 process RTT, voice, and PPLI information. The J0.0 message is required for

 network entry and maintenance.

 The J0.3 message supports subscriber oriented, mission dependent capacity

 assignments.

 The J0.4 message assigns relay capacity for use by Conditional and

 Unconditional Relays operating in the Paired Slot Relay mode.

 The J0.5 message or an appropriate Variable Format Message supports the

 donation of relay transmission time slots.

 The J0.6 message is used to request additional capacity or to delete

 capacity.


-----

###### The J0.7 message is used to request time slots in a time slot reallocation

 pool.

 4.2.5 RELAY CONTROL

 Every JU has the capability to provide relay support for other JUs that are

 beyond LOS of one or more of their associated PGCs. However, every relay

 will not be able to provide the full spectrum of relay options. Restrictions

 such as the PG related relay state or the transmit mode and relay mode likely

 to be implemented by each JU must be taken into account.

 The overall JTIDS/MIDS relay architecture is based upon three compatible, but

 independent, relay modes whose implementation and usage depend upon the types

 of JUs involved and the environment in which they operate. The three modes

 for relay are Paired Slot Relay mode, Repromulgation Relay mode, and

 Addressed Relay mode.

 All relay modes operate on the principle of time slot delay in which messages

 received in one time slot are relayed at a later time in a specified

 preallocated or donated transmission time slot. The relay must take place no

 sooner than the sixth time slot following the time slot in which the original

 message was received. A terminal must have previously achieved Fine

 Synchronization in the Normal mode before it can participate in the relay of

 messages. It is assumed that the performance of relay functions will not

 degrade the JU's performance in other PGs in which it is expected to

 participate as a subscriber. Messages which upon receipt have an

 uncorrectable error are not relayed. RTT Interrogation and Reply messages

 cannot be relayed.

 The following paragraphs provide additional technical considerations for each

 relay mode.

 4.2.5.1 PAIRED SLOT RELAY MODE

 The Paired Slot Relay mode requires the selection and assignment of candidate

 JUs to serve in one of the JTIDS/MIDS terminal relay modes: Unconditional

 Relay or Conditional Relay. Relay receive time slot blocks and relay


-----

###### transmission time slot blocks are assigned to each JU that is selected to

 serve as a relay.

 Paired time slot blocks are assigned as a part of each PG that requires

 Paired Slot Relay mode support. Multiple paired blocks of relay time slots

 can be assigned to a JU. A JU that operates in the Paired Slot Relay mode

 shall indicate its Active or Inactive status in its J2 messages. A JU may be

 assigned to operate in the Paired Slot Relay mode for more than one PG. It

 may be designated as either an Unconditional relay for each PG to which it is

 assigned, or it can be a Conditional Relay for main net, voice channels,

 and/or Control Channels. Paired time slot blocks provide a relatively fixed,

 dedicated access relay capacity that can be changed only by a Network

 Manager.

 In paired slot relay, messages can be relayed either in the same net number

 as that on which the original messages are received or on a different net

 number. In the Partitioned Variable mode terminals can blind relay messages

 for which they do not hold the MSEC variable and therefore cannot read the

 messages.

 4.2.5.1.1 UNCONDITIONAL RELAY MODE

 A JU is assigned to operate as an Unconditional Relay in the Paired Slot

 Relay mode either during initialization or by a J0.4 message addressed to the

 JU by the Network Manager. Certain PGs for which relay support is being

 provided are indicated in the J2 messages of the Unconditional Relay. The

 Unconditional Relay mode should be assigned to JUs that provide the needed

 connectivity among JUs that are not within LOS of each other. The JUs

 selected for this relay mode need a high degree of permanence in the

 geographical area in which they were originally assigned to relay.

 4.2.5.1.2 CONDITIONAL RELAY MODE

 A JU is assigned to operate as a Conditional Relay either during

 initialization or by a J0.4 message addressed to the JU by the Network

 Manager. Certain PGs for which relay support is being provided are indicated

 in the J2 messages of the Conditional Relay. If other Conditional or

 Unconditional Relays are active in the PG and the geographical area covered


-----

###### by assigned Conditional Relays, as indicated in their J2 messages, and are

 situated at a higher altitude, the Conditional Relay remains inactive as a

 relay for this PG. If this is not the case (i.e., if no relay activity is

 reported in the J2 messages received during a specified period of time), the

 assigned Conditional Relay becomes active provided it maintains an altitude

 advantage relative to other JUs. Further details on the Conditional Relay

 are contained in the JTIDS/MIDS Technical Description Section 3.0, Terms and

 Definitions.

 4.2.5.1.3 MESSAGE DIRECTED RELAY MODE FOR JUS

 For JUs participating in an NCS community, a JU may be assigned by the NCS to

 operate as a relay in a Needline PG. If selected, a JU relays only when a

 match occurs between the Relay Select field in the J0.4 message and the

 Message Directed Relay (MDR) field in the Header Extension provided by the

 source of the needline. On a message-to-message basis, the source terminal

 alternates messages between two independent relay paths that are established

 by the NCS using the relay select feature.

 4.2.5.2 REPROMULGATION RELAY MODE

 As an alternative to the Paired Slot Relay mode that must be previously

 assigned by the Network Manager, every JU is capable of acting as a relay on

 a time-slot-to-time-slot basis. The JU must be a member of the PGC for which

 relay support is required. Multiple hops may be achieved without the need to

 establish a path ahead of time. However, the messages relayed by the

 Repromulgation Relay mode cannot be directed to follow a prescribed path

 unless the terminal has been configured and initialized to perform the

 Repromulgation Relay filtering function. The messages shall be relayed by

 all JUs that receive the messages if they are in the active Repromulgation

 Relay Mode. This relay will occur provided that the donated time slots do

 not conflict with previously assigned transmission/reception requirements on

 a different net. The Repromulgation Relay mode does not require intervention

 of the Network Manager.


-----

###### 4.2.5.3 ADDRESSED RELAY

 This relay mode provides a distributed capability to each JU to determine the

 exact route/path along which a message is relayed. This method is

 particularly suited to addressed messages in which a centrally managed,

 Paired Slot Relay mode fails to provide the necessary paths.

 The information needed to determine which JUs can be addressed for relay is

 obtained from the J2 messages and the J1.1 messages. Since management of the

 relays to be addressed is performed by the subscribing JUs, the Network

 Manager merely assigns sufficient capacity to each JU to include the relay

 capacity that is subsequently donated by the originating JU for the use of

 the relay terminal on a message-by-message basis.

 An adaptive routing algorithm must make efficient use of the following items:

 a. A JU's capacity management function.

 b. A JU's position assessment capability.

 c. A JU's identification capability.

 A JU's capacity is determined by the time slots assigned to it for

 transmission and reception. Time slots are assigned either statically or

 dynamically using the J0.3 message. Position and identification information

 are also available through dynamic exchange of J2 messages or through other

 means. An additional level of control over JU relay functions is through a

 routing algorithm that uses dynamically exchanged J1.0 Connectivity

 Interrogation messages, J1.1 messages, J1.2 Route Establishment messages. 

 These messages identify the JUs that participate in routing.

 The information needed to control a relay by addressing is obtained in two

 phases, address data initialization and address data maintenance.

 The Addressed Relay mode requires address data that identify a JU as a

 destination or as a relay. In order to originate messages using the

 Addressed Relay mode, a JU must initialize and maintain an address database

 that includes the following items:


-----

###### a. A destination list (16(16-32,1) TNs).

 b. A direct connectivity list (8(8-16,1) TNs).

 c. Indirect connectivity lists (8(8-16,1) x 8(8-16,1) TNs).

 d. A connectivity matrix (64(48-128,1) x 64(48-128,1) CQs and

 associated 64(48-128,1) TNs).

 e. Destination associated relay lists (16(16-32,1) x 8(8-10,1) TNs).

 f. Route lists (8(8-16,1) x 8(8-10,1) TNs).

 For an explanation of the preceding parameters, see paragraph 5.7.1c.

 A JU that can be controlled in the Addressed Relay mode is also required to

 initialize and maintain a source/route number list with up to 32 entries of

 source/route number combinations. The use of these lists and matrices is

 discussed below.

 All required information for the address database may not be available at

 terminal initiation time. Address data initialization must therefore be

 completed through the use of the J1.0, J1.1, and J1.2 messages.

 The messages are exchanged on the same net dedicated to fundamental

 applications in order to maximize connectivity. Initially, Network

 Management messages comprise a high percentage of the net capacity. However,

 as the participating terminals complete their various addressing lists and

 the connectivity bit matrix, the capacity will be quickly released for

 predominantly functional exchanges.

 When T represents the number of transmitters operating per unit time in a

 given net, the average Recurrence Rate of each transmitter is given by:

 a. R = 15-log2 (T/3).

 The integer part of R may therefore be initially assigned to all transmitting

 JUs as a baseline for dynamic allocation/reallocation required to adjust and


-----

###### shift the net from its initial primary orientation of Network Management to a

 final functional mission orientation.

 To complete the address database, a terminal must first have initialized its

 destination list array. This is normally done through the host platform. To

 complete the direct connectivity list, one or more of the following

 alternatives is used: monitoring the Initial Entry Network PG, monitoring

 the PPLI Network PG and monitoring the RTT Network PG.

 The J0.0 message is augmented with local connectivity information. The

 initializing terminal may transmit RTT Interrogation messages to specific

 destination terminals to obtain connectivity information.

 It is required that each JU shall be within LOS of at least one other JU. If

 a JU is in danger of isolation, measures must be taken to position additional

 JUs as required to maintain communications.

 During the buildup of its direct connectivity list, a JU may find a TN

 matching a required destination. Therefore, direct functional communications

 with that JU may be initiated immediately on the same net.

 If one or more destination TNs are not matched by the direct connectivity

 list, the terminal may begin to build indirect connectivity lists

 corresponding to JUs given in the direct connectivity list. There are two

 ways to obtain indirect connectivity lists (assuming they are not available

 off line). One way is to monitor the addressed communications of directly

 connected JUs and other JUs. The second way is to use J1.0 messages. 

 Interrogated JUs then reply with J1.1 messages from which indirect

 connectivity lists can be compiled. By interrogating JUs on the direct

 connectivity list and subsequently interrogating JUs on the indirect

 connectivity lists, the required connectivity matrix is completed.

 During the buildup of the indirect connectivity lists, a JU may find a TN

 matching a required destination. Functional communication with that JU is

 then possible through use of the associated relays. At that point functional

 messages can be formulated with a header extension word that identifies the

 relays and provides the capacity required for the relays to retransmit the

 message.


-----

###### To achieve routing through multiple relays, several J1.0 messages may be

 required. By interrogating potential relays identified in the first level of

 indirect connectivity lists and obtaining their J1.1 messages, a connectivity

 matrix is initialized. Analogous to a bootstrapping process, destination

 associated relay lists are also initialized. Once a relay list is completed

 for a particular destination, functional messages may be exchanged with that

 destination using the header extension words that identify the associated

 relays and provide the needed capacity for each relay to transmit the

 message.

 If communications to particular destinations or through a number of relays

 are frequent, the Route Number may be initialized and established by

 transmitting a J1.2 message that includes all the relays on the route and

 that provides the Route Number which shall be used in the header extension

 words in lieu of the string of relay TNs. A JU receiving a J1.2 message with

 its own Source TN as a relay or destination is required to store the Route

 Number along with the Source TN for filtering future receptions. A JU is

 required to store up to 4(4-8,1) Route Numbers for up to 4(4-8,1) sources. 

 This list is called the source/route number list. A source JU shall

 establish preferred and alternate routes based upon the connectivity

 information available and a minimum-hop, path-finding algorithm. Relays on

 the route are stored in lists called route lists. The route list is

 identified by a Route Number. For each Route Number, a variable number of up

 to 16 relays and/or destination TNs make up the route list.

 The control over the initialization of the JU address database is two-fold. 

 Initialization may proceed under direct control by an operator or host

 computer. In contrast, the initialization process may proceed automatically

 employing a trial and error search algorithm. Maintenance of the JU address

 database is similarly controlled. However, J1.0, J1.1 and J1.2 messages are

 exchanged at a much slower rate during database maintenance.

 The general message flow from a source perspective is diagramed in Figure

 4.2-1. A normal sequence of events is identified through the time slot

 subscripts. The general message flow from a relay/destination perspective is

 diagramed in Figure 4.2-2.


-----

###### 4.2.5.4 MESSAGES USED IN SUPPORT OF THE RELAY METHODS

 The J2 messages are used to support the Paired Slot Relay and Addressed Relay

 modes.

 The J0.0 message provides optional connectivity information to support the

 Addressed Relay mode.

 The J0.4 message is required to assign relays and paired time slot blocks to

 support the Paired Slot Relay mode.

 The J0.5 message supports the Repromulgation Relay mode.

 The J1.0, J1.1, and J1.2 messages support the Addressed Relay mode.

 4.2.6 NETWORK INITIALIZATION, ENTRY, MAINTENANCE, AND EXIT

 A JU designated as the NTR is essential to network initialization, entry, and

 maintenance. The NTR must be assigned by the Network Manager. In addition,

 alternate NTRs must be identified and activated by the Network Manager in

 nonreal time through a nonJTIDS/MIDS communications medium.

###### FIGURE 4.2-2. General Data Flow Routing(Relay/Destination Perspective)


-----

###### A JU becomes an NTR through operator action once it is assigned by the

 Network Manager. When an NTR JU starts to transmit messages, other JUs may

 enter the network after initializing themselves as Primary Users (by

 employing RTT messages) or as Secondary Users (by employing J2 messages)

 during achievement of Fine Synchronization. As identified by the J0.0

 message, special PGs called RTT and PPLI are allocated on the main net (Net

 Number 0) for all JUs. The Network Entry PG is Set A, with ISN equal to 0,

 and RRN equal to 6. This assignment is built into all Class 2 JTIDS/MIDS

 terminals and, for operational purposes, it is a fixed assignment.

 Maintenance of network synchronization is automatic. It does not require

 Network Manager intervention except as already discussed under dynamic time

 slot management; it does require that the NTR is functioning properly.

 To facilitate Network Management, JUs that exit the network are required to

 transmit their change of participation status. Dynamically allocated

 capacity to an existing JU may be cleared for reallocation to JUs that have

 requested more capacity or to new JUs that have recently entered the network.

 When over-the-air rekeying is used, the Net Manager is responsible for the

 administration, coordination and distribution of a unique variable to each of

 the subscribers in his net in accordance with COMSEC procedures. The unique

 variable is used by the KGV-8 to decrypt and process J31.0 Over-the-Air

 Rekeying Management and J31.1 Over-the-Air Rekeying messages.

 4.2.6.1 JTIDS/MIDS UNIT TERMINAL INITIALIZATION

 The JU terminal must be initialized properly to support Network Management. 

 All terminals in a network must be initialized to operate in a common

 communications mode, common time of day, and common network entry TRANSEC

 cryptovariable. Network time is the clock time of the JU that has been

 designated to be NTR. Ideally, this time should be the same as Greenwich

 Mean Time (GMT) or some other standard time. The primary reason for using a

 standard time is to facilitate network entry.

 Additional JU terminal initialization parameters depend upon the subscriber's

 mission and the degree to which the Network Manager can rely upon a

 particular subscriber to support the network entry, relay, and network


-----

###### maintenance functions. The JU identified by the Network Manager to act as an

 NTR shall initialize the Organization User Type as NTR. All JUs have the

 option, depending upon their mission, to declare their Organization User Type

 as Navigation Controller (NC) and/or Position Reference (PR). All JUs except

 the NTR, NC, and PR shall declare their Organization User Type as Primary

 User or Secondary User. NCs and PRs are Primary Users. NonNTR JUs must also

 enter the uncertainty of the time of day into the terminal. JUs that are

 Secondary Users must enter their initial position and position quality to

 enable them to achieve Fine Synchronization. The Network Manager must

 provide initial time slot blocks for the NTR and Primary Users to transmit J2

 messages essential for achieving Fine Synchronization using the Passive mode.

 A JU identified by the Network Manager to serve as a Conditional or

 Unconditional Relay shall initialize its relay assignments for each time slot

 block specified by the Network Manager. The relay assignments may be

 subsequently updated by the J0.4 message.

 JUs that are Primary Users must be assigned RTT time slot blocks for use in

 interrogating the NTR, other Primary Users, PRs and NCs. Two types of RTT

 Interrogations are possible: RTT Interrogation-Addressed and RTT

 Interrogation-Broadcast. The Network Manager may preclude the use of one

 type or the other by not assigning time slot pools. RTT-A may be transmitted

 only in a dedicated pool, and RTT-B may be transmitted only in a contention

 pool. If both types of pools are assigned, the JU shall transmit the

 appropriate RTT message in the next available time slot assigned for RTT

 transmissions commensurate with the time quality triggering the requirement.

 A JU (other than the NTR or an active main net relay) that is selected by the

 Network Manager to facilitate the network entry of other JUs by transmitting

 J0.0 messages must be initialized as an IEJU.

 Prior to initialization, each JU shall be provided with the following:

 a. Network entry parameters (net number and network entry TRANSEC and

 MSEC, as required) associated with the joint Network Manager or a subordinate

 Network Manager (intra-Service).


-----

###### b. Time slot assignments and their associated cryptovariables for the

 static PGs.

 c. A "unique variable" if over-the-air rekeying is used.

 4.2.6.2 NETWORK ENTRY

 The process of network entry is described in the following paragraphs.

 4.2.6.2.1 FIRST JTIDS/MIDS UNIT IN THE NETWORK

 Figure 4.2-3 shows the network entry process in flowchart form. The first JU

 in the network is initially designated the NTR JU and enters the network

 entry TRANSEC cryptovariable, MSEC cryptovariable if required, and network

 time. (There is only one NTR JU in a JTIDS/MIDS network.) This unit's

 transmit time slots are assigned during terminal initiation (e.g., by

 operations order or by operator designation). Once time slots are assigned,

 the JU can then begin transmitting J0 messages, J2 messages, and others.

 4.2.6.2.2 SECOND AND SUBSEQUENT JTIDS/MIDS UNITS ENTERING THE NETWORK

 Once an NTR JU has initiated a JTIDS/MIDS network, another JU enters the

 network by:

 a. Entering the TRANSEC cryptovariable and MSEC cryptovariable as

 required.

 b. Entering network time with an estimated uncertainty.

 c. Entering a position estimate and position quality (for the Passive

 mode of synchronization, using J2 messages).

 d. Entering the desired synchronization method:

   - Active.

   - Passive.

 e. Attempting receipt of the J0.0 messages, which will enable Coarse

 Synchronization. (The NTR, active main net relays, and IEJUs will transmit


-----

###### J0.0 messages in known time slots.) (A JU participating in an NCS community

 may also be initialized over-the-air using the J1.5 message to activate as an

 IEJU.)

 Receipt of a J0.0 message establishes Coarse Synchronization. Once Coarse

 Synchronization is established, the unit can receive on all time slots and

 can achieve Fine Synchronization either Actively or Passively. If the

 Passive mode is selected, the unit must receive J2 messages until Fine

 Synchronization is achieved. Selection of the Active mode for Fine

 Synchronization requires the assignment of time slots for RTT Interrogation

 and Reply exchange.


-----

###### FIGURE 4.2-3. Flow Diagram of Network Entry (Sheet 1 of 2)


-----

###### FIGURE 4.2-3. Flow Diagram of Network Entry (Sheet 2 of 2)


-----

###### 4.2.6.2.3 ACTIVE MODE FOR ACHIEVING SYNCHRONIZATION

 A JU operating as a Primary User shall use the Active mode to obtain and

 maintain Fine Synchronization. The Active mode uses RTT Interrogations and

 RTT Replies. The RTT-B Interrogation is used to transmit a nonaddressed

 (broadcast) interrogation and is used in the RTT group in the Contention

 Access mode. Otherwise, the RTT-A Interrogation, which is addressed to a

 specified terminal, is used. Computation of system time from an RTT

 Interrogation/Reply sequence using either interrogation type provides the

 same accuracy. Independently derived position data are not required or used

 when operating in the Active mode.

 The terminal responds to RTT Interrogations unless the terminal is in the

 Conditional Radio Silence or Polling mode or the last pulse of the

 interrogation arrives later than 3,375 microseconds after the start of the

 time slot. The RTT Reply is transmitted, in the same time slot and net as

 the RTT Interrogation, 4,275 microseconds after the start of the time slot. 

 In the RTT group, the terminal programs to receive interrogations on a net

 number equal to its own time quality. The initiation of an RTT sequence will

 not exceed a rate of once per three minutes. Use of the Active mode does not

 preclude the simultaneous use of the Passive mode.

 4.2.6.2.4 TIME SLOTS FOR ROUND-TRIP-TIMING EXCHANGE

 RTT transmit time slots are assigned during terminal initialization or by the

 J0.0 message. Once the transmit time slots are defined, the RTT exchange can

 commence. A unit will not transmit messages other than RTT Interrogations

 until Fine Synchronization is achieved. The process of achieving Fine

 Synchronization shall be repeated as required.

 4.2.6.2.5 PASSIVE MODE FOR ACHIEVING SYNCHRONIZATION

 A JU operating as a Secondary User achieves and maintains Fine

 Synchronization primarily in the Passive mode. In the Passive mode, the

 terminal processes selected J2 messages and TOA data in a combined

 navigation/synchronization filter. Passive synchronization is performed

 without any transmissions by the terminal. However, if the terminal is not

 operating in the Radio Silence mode, Secondary Users may use RTT to augment


-----

###### the basic Passive mode only under conditions of initial Fine Synchronization

 when good geometry for the Passive mode does not exist. Secondary Users

 initiate an RTT sequence only as required to maintain a time variance within

 25% of position variance, but not more often than one RTT sequence per epoch.

 4.2.6.2.6 NET CONTROL STATION COMMUNITY NET CONTROL ENTRY

 In an NCS community, Net Control Entry procedures are initiated after a JU

 achieves Fine Synchronization. The NCS JU will be the first JU to solicit

 other JUs with the same Community Designator that need to achieve Net Control

 Entry. Net Control Entry is said to be achieved when a JU receives the J1.5

 message from the NCS, and the JU responds with periodic J1.4 messages. The

 following definitions are also often used in describing Net Control Entry:

 a. Communicant - a transmitting JU capable of being heard directly

 (without relay) by a receiving JU.

 b. Community of JUs - a community of JUs initialized to have the same

 Community Designator.

 c. Intracommunity Communicant - a transmitting JU holding a Community

 Designator identical to that of the receiving JU.

 d. Intercommunity Communicant - a transmitting JU holding a Community

 Designator different than that of the receiving JU.

 e. External Communicant - a transmitting JU not initialized to have a

 Community Designator.

 The NCS is the first JU to be initialized in its own community of JUs. The

 NCS builds the control network for its community by transmitting J1.4

 messages in the Net Status Needline PG. The J1.4 message solicits JUs in its

 community to enter the NCS control network by providing information necessary

 to compute the time slot in which the transmitting JU (initially only the

 NCS) will expect to receive the J1.1 message to be transmitted by the JUs

 that are in line-of-sight of the transmitter and wish to enter the NCS

 community. Thus all JUs attempting Net Control Entry that are within LOS of

 the NCS will be in contention during this time slot; the new entrant whose


-----

###### transmission is captured by the NCS will achieve Net Control Entry first. 

 Since any JU will continue to attempt Net Control Entry by repeatedly

 responding to net entry solicitations, all JUs within LOS of the NCS will

 eventually achieve Net Control Entry.

 The NCS establishes these JUs as the first level of relays; these JUs in turn

 begin to solicit their intracommunity LOS communicants beyond LOS of the NCS

 to achieve Net Control Entry. In order for the NCS to transmit a J1.5

 message to JUs beyond its LOS, the NCS must establish a route to the new

 entrant JU using J0.4 messages. While monitoring transmissions on the net

 number of this Net Status Needline PG, a new entrant JU is accumulating a

 list of communicants by inspecting the header of every message it receives

 and computing the connectivity quality from each communicant by counting

 erasures received within one time slot.

 In case of an NCS failure, the backup NCS must reestablish Net Control Entry

 for all JUs under the control of the failed NCS. JUs beyond LOS of the

 failed NCS are made aware of the failure by processing the J1.4 message of

 JUs closer or within LOS of the failed NCS.

 4.2.6.3 NETWORK MAINTENANCE

 JTIDS/MIDS network maintenance includes maintenance of the synchronization

 process and the connectivity process. The maintenance of both processes is

 facilitated by monitoring the Network Participation Status Indicator (NPS

 IND) to determine if JUs key to synchronization and connectivity (such as the

 NTR), network entry, and active or potentially active relay service are

 operational or require replacement. The Network Manager shall identify JUs

 as candidate alternates to accommodate these functions. Alternates shall not

 be activated until required based upon the NPS IND of the active NTR, IEJUs,

 and relay JUs. If possible, the JUs actively performing these functions

 shall be notified when the assignments are to be changed or deleted.

 JUs participating in an NCS community must monitor the status of each path of

 their own Needline PGs using acknowledgement techniques and periodic "probe"

 messages. Since needlines may be response time driven, their allocated time

 slots may far exceed their actual usage. "Probe" messages will be sent by

 source JUs during every eighth allocated time slot starting with the first


-----

###### executable time slot if no other messages are awaiting transmission. The

 destination JU will determine the path performance using a sequential

 hypothesis algorithm. If the algorithm indicates a path failure, the

 destination JU will transmit the J0.6 message to the NCS indicating which

 Needline PG has failed and requesting corrective action. The NCS will

 analyze the failure to determine the required corrective action, which may

 range from taking no corrective action, if failure is analyzed to be

 temporary, to the provision of a complete replacement for the failed path.

 4.2.6.3.1 NETWORK TIME UPDATE

 Whenever the J0.2 message is received in an initial entry time slot, all JUs

 designated to transmit the J0.0 message shall begin transmitting the J0.2

 message following the J0.0 message in the initial entry time slot. The JUs

 shall continue these transmissions until the execution time in the J0.2

 message.

 4.2.6.3.2 NETWORK PARTICIPATION STATUS

 A Link 11, 11B, or 16 unit shall be considered in either an Active (full

 interface participant) Status, Inactive (not participating in the interface)

 Status, or Limited (interface participation less than full) Status on the

 interface.

 a. Active Status. A Link 11, 11B, or 16 unit shall be considered in

 the Active status on the interface when the NPS IND in the J2 messages is set

 to Active. A Link 16 participant in the Active Status must be in the Normal

 mode, in Fine Synchronization, and capable of exchanging messages on the

 JTIDS/MIDS network.

 b. Return to an Active Status. Return to an Active Status is shown in

 Figure 4.2-4. A JU shall return to Active Status after leaving the network

 (Terminal Off or Loss of Coarse Synchronization) by following the net entry

 procedure as stated in paragraph 4.2.6.2.2. A JU shall return to Active

 Status from the Radio Silence mode, the Polling mode, Loss of Fine

 Synchronization mode, TDS Failure mode, Receiver High Message Error Rate

 mode, Transmitter Failure mode, Out of Range/Masked mode, or Receiver Failure

 mode by transmitting the J2 message with the NPS IND field set to Active. 


-----

###### When an FJU determines that a PU or RU has returned to Active Status, it

 shall set the NPS IND to Active in the J2.0 Indirect Interface Unit PPLI

 message.

 c. Inactive Status. A PU, RU, or JU shall be considered in an

 Inactive Status on the interface upon receipt of a J2 message with the NPS

 IND set to Inactive or if a J2 message has not been received on that unit for

 a period of at least 60 seconds.

 d. Changing to Inactive Status. A JU shall set the NPS IND to

 Inactive immediately prior to leaving the JTIDS/MIDS network. Additionally,

 when a FJU determines that a PU/RU is Inactive, it shall set the NPS IND to

 Inactive in the J2.0 message for the PU/RU.


-----

###### FIGURE 4.2-4. Flow Diagram of Network Participation Status Change to Active Status (Sheet 1 of 2)


-----

###### FIGURE 4.2-4. Flow Diagram of Network Participation Status Change to Active Status (Sheet 2 of 2)


-----

###### e. Limited Status. The change to Limited Status is shown in Figure

 4.2-5. The decision on retention of time slots is an operator decision. A

 JU shall be considered in a Limited Status on the interface when the NPS IND

 is set to any of the following:

 (1) Polling.

 (2) Radio Silence.

 (3) No J0.0 Message Being Received.

 (4) High Error Rate.

 (5) TDS Failure.

 f. Polling and Radio Silence Modes. The Polling and Radio Silence

 modes are described in Section 3, Terms and Definitions. A Link 16 unit

 shall set the appropriate value in the NPS IND when changing to one of these

 Limited Statuses.

 g. No J0.0 Message Being Received. Some causes of No J0.0 Message

 Being Received are receiver failure, being out of range, or being out of LOS. 

 When a J0.0 message has not been received for 120(60-180,12) seconds, the

 terminal shall alert the operator and set the NPS IND to No J0.0 Message

 Being Received. Network entry opportunities are discussed in paragraph

 4.2.3.10.1. (This indicator may provide input to the conditional relay

 algorithm of a receiving terminal to determine possible activation of the

 Relay Function.)

 h. High Error Rate. A High Error Rate of received messages can be

 caused by a number of conditions, including jamming. The NPS IND shall be

 set to High Error Rate when the ratio of messages received with error to the

 total messages received exceeds 10(5-100,5)%.

 i. Tactical Data System Failure. The NPS IND shall be set to TDS

 Failure when the terminal can no longer communicate with the host TDS.

-----

###### 4.2.6.3.3 CRYPTOVARIABLE CHANGE

 The cryptovariable for each cryptonet will be changed periodically (every 24

 hours) or in reaction to compromise situations. This change over must be

 coordinated by the Network Manager among all of the participants within the

 net.

 4.2.6.3.4 OVER-THE-AIR REKEYING (OTAR)

 OTAR provides dynamic rekeying capability to JUs. This flexibility is

 provided OTAR JUs by the J31.0 and J31.1 message types. The new

 cryptovariable to be used by a JU is transmitted in message J31.1 and is

 protected by being uniquely encrypted by another cryptovariable referred to

 as the unique cryptovariable. The unique cryptovariable is held only by the

 rekeying facility and the receiving JU. Other JUs in the same cryptonet can

 receive the J31.1 message but are not able to decipher the cryptovariable

 portion of the J31.1 message. Each JU in a cryptonet has a unique

 cryptovariable assigned for decrypting new cryptovariables transmitted to

 that JU via the J31.1 message.

 OTAR allows the Network Manager to change cryptoperiods and to dynamically

 change net connectivity for operational reasons or in reaction to a

 compromise situation.

 The J31.0 message is used by the Network Manager to transmit an execution

 time and/or cryptovariable synchronization bits to a receiving JU if required

 or by a JU to request a new cryptovariable. The sequence and specific use of

 J31.0 and J31.1 message types is determined by the over-the-air action codes

 specified within the J31.0 and J31.1 messages.

 4.2.6.4 MESSAGES USED IN SUPPORT OF NETWORK INITIALIZATION, ENTRY,

 MAINTENANCE, AND EXIT

 The J0.0 message is used to achieve Coarse Synchronization.

 The J0.2 message is used by the NTR to correct for drift of its clock

 relative to system time.


-----

###### The J0.6 message is used to request time slot block assignments and to

 release time slot block assignments.

 The RTT Interrogation and Reply messages are used to support the active

 achievement and maintenance of Fine Synchronization.

 The J2 messages are used to support the passive achievement and maintenance

 of Fine Synchronization.

 The J31 messages are used to support over-the-air rekeying.

 4.2.6.5 TERMINAL TESTING

 The terminal requires the receipt of a predetermined pattern of bits to

 perform internal, on-line circuit testing. The J0.1 message shall be

 transmitted when the terminal is operating in one of the test modes or upon

 receipt of a request for a J0.1 message when operating in the Normal or

 Polling mode. The J0.1 message consists of the J0.1I Test initial word, the

 J0.1E0 Test extension word, and the J0.1C21 Test continuation word. The bit

 pattern in the test message's extension and continuation words allows the

 terminal to check its bit processing circuit for both the 0 and 1 conditions

 of every bit in the 70 information bits. Parity bits are not checked. The

 J0.1 message pattern is used to check the number and location of error

 corrections in the Reed-Solomon decoder. This J0.1 message is also used in

 either of the test modes to flood the JTIDS/MIDS network with messages. In

 Test Mode 1, the JU transmits J0.1 messages in all time slots assigned for

 the Dedicated Access mode and in all time slots that would ordinarily be used

 for Contention Access except for Initial Entry time slots and RTT time slots. 

 In Test Mode 2, the JU transmits J0.1 messages only in the Dedicated Access

 time slots, except for time slots in common blocks assigned to Control and

 Voice PGs, that are not used to transmit other messages.

 4.2.7 CRYPTOGRAPHIC NETWORK DESCRIPTION, OPERATION, AND COMPROMISE

 4.2.7.1 CRYPTONET FUNDAMENTALS

 The purpose of the cryptonet structure is to maintain communications security

 while permitting the exchange and distribution of operationally required data


-----

###### on a need-to-know basis. Individual cryptonets may contain one or more PGs

 based on operational data exchange requirements. The data exchange

 requirement is established by analysis of the following:

 a. Operational need of each participating JU for the overall data

 content of the net.

 b. Operational impact of compromise of the data content of the net.

 c. Vulnerability of the net to compromise either by capture of one of

 the participating JUs or by compromise of the network cryptovariable by other

 means.

 4.2.7.1.1 CRYPTONET PLAN

 The communications plan identifies each cryptonet by its Cryptovariable

 Logical Label (CVLL) (0 through 127) and its cryptovariable short title. 

 This data is used to prepare the mission load parameters for each

 participating JU and to provide instructions by which cryptovariables will be

 loaded into the terminal. The mission load references the CVLL and the

 cryptoperiod designator codes to the Secure Data Unit (SDU) memory locations

 and defines the current cryptoperiod designator, while the instructions for

 cryptovariable loading reference the cryptovariable short title of the

 cryptovariable going into these memory locations.

 4.2.7.1.2 DYNAMIC/STATIC CRYPTONET PARTICIPATION

 Most JUs can automatically shift cryptonets. The number of cryptonets used

 is based on authorization, terminal capability, and today/tomorrow operation. 

 The Class 2 terminal can operate on up to eight cryptonets. The Class 1

 terminal can operate in only one cryptonet unless manually changed.

 4.2.7.1.3 CRYPTOVARIABLE DISTRIBUTION

 Initially, the cryptovariables will be supplied to the individual JUs as

 required in the communication plan using the present manual COMSEC material

 control system. This system is rigid, time consuming, vulnerable to Human

 Intelligence (HUMINT) exploitation, and limits the ability to reassign JUs


-----

###### beyond their communication plan assignments. OTAR is planned for later use

 to enhance operational capability and responsiveness while reducing the

 HUMINT vulnerability.

 4.2.7.2 CRYPTONET OPERATION

 4.2.7.2.1 CRYPTONET INITIALIZATION, ENTRY, AND MAINTENANCE

 In order for a JU to establish or operate on a secure data net it must first

 be provided with specific initialization data.

 Required data consists of two parts. The first part deals with the technical

 characteristics of the assignment of specific time slot blocks to the PGCs. 

 It is discussed in detail in Paragraph 4.2.6. The second part of this

 initialization data deals with the assignment of specific cryptovariables

 that the JU will require in order to conduct operations in designated secure

 nets. The Network Manager implements the communication plan by assigning JUs

 to JTIDS/MIDS Nets. The Cryptonet Manager will then assign cryptovariables

 to specific JUs based on their operational needs. With the implementation of

 OTAR, the Cryptonet Manager must also assign each individual JU with a unique

 cryptovariable required to process the OTAR messages.

 The Cryptonet Manager must assign a specific cryptovariable to the Net Entry

 PG (Set A with ISN equal to 0 and RRN equal to 6). This net entry assignment

 is built into each Class 2 terminal and requires only the assignment of the

 required cryptovariable to initialize and enter the net.

 Only the TRANSEC cryptovariable is required to initially enter or establish

 the net. Once coarse synchronization is achieved, the MSEC cryptovariable

 will be required to complete the process.

 4.2.7.2.2 CRYPTONET PARTICIPANT ASSIGNMENT, AUTHORIZATION AND

 VALIDATION

 Based on several factors, a JU is assigned to a single or multiple cryptonet

 by the Cryptonet Manager. The basic and most important consideration is the

 need for the JU to have access to the PGCs served by the cryptonets. The

 second consideration is the sensitivity of the data access that the JU


-----

###### requires in order to complete the operational mission. All JUs operating

 together will require access to the large scale PPLI net and the Initial

 Entry net. Their assignment to other nets, however, will be based on their

 need for access to each of the cryptonets. The Initial Entry cryptonet and

 the PPLI cryptonet will normally utilize the same TRANSEC variable. These

 cryptonets, however, may be divided into separate cryptonets, or they may be

 subnetted using different MSEC variables to achieve separate cryptosubnets in

 order to reduce the number of JUs that participate on a single cryptonet.

 The authority for assigning JUs to a cryptonet rests with the Cryptonet

 Manager.

 4.2.7.3 CRYPTONET COMPROMISE

 A cryptonet compromise is the loss or exposure of the cryptovariables being

 used by a net for communications security. Containment and prevention are

 the only protective measures against compromise. Containment means reducing

 the impact of compromise on operating cryptonets. Prevention includes the

 protective measures used to prevent the loss or exposure of cryptovariables

 during distribution and use.

 Although several PGCs may use the same cryptonet, a compromise of any JU

 using any of these PGCs would compromise the data on all of the PGCs on that

 cryptonet. A degree of protection against compromise is provided by the

 implementation of different cryptonets, since different sets of messages are

 transmitted using different cryptovariables and only a subset of system

 information can be compromised when a single cryptonet is compromised.

 4.2.7.3.1 IMPACT OF COMPROMISE

 Compromise of a cryptonet can have serious consequences to the physical

 security (e.g., Targeting) of the JUs operating on that network as well as to

 the content of data passed on that net. Compromise may or may not be

 detected at the time of compromise. If a compromised unit remains completely

 passive, it may gain useful intelligence for the period that the cryptonet

 continues using the same cryptovariable. A compromised terminal can actively

 be used to defeat net management, relay, time reference, and other system

 services.


-----

###### 4.2.7.3.2. DETECTION OF A COMPROMISE

 Detection of a compromise can be accomplished:

 a. By verification of an actual overrun or evidence of a penetration.

 b. If a JU requests access to a cryptonet that it should not be in.

 c. By any sudden disruptions resulting from jamming or any other loss

 of operational effectiveness.

 d. By the detection of data that is incorrect in style and/or content.

 e. By recognition of a false unit reporting on the PPLI net.

 4.2.7.3.3 REACTION TO COMPROMISE

 When the Cryptonet Manager suspects a compromise of a given JU, the Cryptonet

 Manager will isolate the given JU from other PGs on the cryptonet by changing

 cryptovariable(s). With OTAR, the rekeying facility accomplishes this by

 sending the J31.1 message to the given JU. This should be followed by

 changing the cryptovariable(s) of the remaining PGs on the cryptonet (via

 transmission of J31.1 messages) to a set of cryptovariable(s) that differs

 from the cryptovariable(s) of the compromised JU. If it is later verified

 that the suspected JU is not compromised, the JU can be returned to the

 cryptonet by the transmission of a J31.1 message. Without OTAR, the

 uncompromised JUs must be manually changed to a different cryptovariable(s).

 4.2.7.4 OVER-THE-AIR REKEYING

 OTAR is an alternative means of cryptovariable distribution. From the

 network management point of view, the particular means used for distribution

 of the cryptovariables is usually unimportant in terms of structuring the

 network. However, there are important differences in Cryptonet Management

 and in resource utilization. Since a cryptovariable can be loaded into the

 SDU by the terminal in response to an OTAR message, rekeying can be

 accomplished without direct physical access to the SDU. This provides the

 capability: (a) to issue new cryptovariables in connection with dynamic


-----

###### restructuring of the network, (b) to rapidly recover from compromise

 situations, and (c) to facilitate routine changing of cryptovariables without

 the use of rollover. In order to accomplish OTAR, two storage locations in

 the SDU must be reserved. One is for a unique cryptovariable and the other

 for temporary storage of the new cryptovariable while processing. This

 reduces the number of storage locations available for use by a JU. If OTAR

 is used for routine changing of cryptovariables instead of rollover, there is

 a gain in the number of cryptovariables which can be used during a given

 cryptoperiod.

 OTAR requires assignment of communications capacity, including relay

 capacity, for the transmission of OTAR messages. The amount of capacity

 required is determined by the number of participants in each cryptonet and

 the time required for assigning cryptovariables. Once the time limits and

 number of participants have been determined, the capacity requirements can be

 calculated (See paragraph 4.2.1.2).

 4.2.7.4.1 OVER-THE-AIR REKEYING SYSTEM PARTICIPANTS

 OTAR system participants include the OTAR rekeying facility(ies) and remote

 JTIDS/MIDS Units.

 a. The OTAR rekey facility shall include the System Controller, a

 rekey JU, and the KOK-11/TSEC. The System Controller interfaces with the

 KOK-11 to obtain new cryptovariables. It formats J31.0 and J31.1 OTAR

 messages and provides these messages to the rekey JU which transmits these

 messages to a remote JU. The rekey facility maintains a database of the

 cryptographic status of each JU operating under its control.

 b. A remote JU is any unit capable of operating with OTAR.

 4.2.7.4.2 OVER-THE-AIR REKEYING MESSAGES

 The OTAR messages are J series messages used for the distribution of the

 cryptovariables. They consist of the J31.0 and J31.1 messages. The J0.6

 message may be used in conjunction with the OTAR messages to dynamically

 control the use and assignment of cryptonets. The Network Management

 messages are discussed elsewhere in this section. The J31.1 message is used


-----

###### as a rekeying message while the J31.0 message is used as a Change

 Cryptovariable at Time Specified message, Packed OTAR message, Packed Over
 the-MUX Rekeying (OTMR) message, Cryptovariable Status Request message,

 Cryptovariable Status Report message, Direct Cryptovariable Request message,

 and Indirect Cryptovariable Request message. In addition, Receipt/Compliance

 messages are required to indicate the status of received messages.

 a. The J31.0 (ACT = 1) Change Cryptovariable at Time Specified message

 is generated by the System Controller and is always used in conjunction with

 a J31.1 message, transmitted in a different time slot, to deliver a new

 cryptovariable to a remote JU. Execution time is always other than

 immediate.

 b. The J31.0 (ACT = 2) Cryptovariable Status Report message is

 generated by a remote JU in response to a J31.0 (ACT = 5) message. It

 incorporates the cryptovariable status of the queried JU.

 c. The J31.0 (ACT = 3) Direct Cryptovariable Request message is

 generated by a remote JU to request a new cryptovariable.

 d. The J31.0 (ACT = 4) Indirect Cryptovariable Request message is

 generated by an authorized remote JU to request a new cryptovariable for a

 remote JU other than itself.

 e. The J31.0 (ACT = 5) Cryptovariable Status Request message is

 generated by the System Controller to obtain the cryptovariable status of a

 remote JU to enable the System Controller to generate a new cryptovariable

 for that JU.

 f. The J31.0 (ACT = 6) Packed OTAR message is generated by the System

 Controller and is used in the same time slot with a J31.1 (ACT = 6) message

 to deliver a cryptovariable to a remote JU. Execution time is always other

 than immediate. The terminal will provide an R/C response to the J31.0 (ACT

 = 6) message, and in the same time slot will include the J31.1 (ACT = 6)

 message with values in each field of the J31.1 which are unchanged from those

 received.


-----

###### g. The J31.0 (ACT = 7) Packed OTMR message is generated by the System

 Controller and is used in the same time slot with a J31.1 (ACT = 7) message

 to deliver a cryptovariable to its own terminal. Execution time is always

 other than immediate. The terminal does not provide an R/C response to this

 message or to the subsequent J31.1 (ACT = 7) message.

 h. The J31.1 message is generated by the System Controller. It

 conveys the data necessary to deliver a new cryptovariable to a JU. The J31.1

 can be used alone to rekey a remote JU but not to rekey the System

 Controller's own terminal. Further, it can be used alone to rekey a remote

 JU only if the new cryptovariable is to be loaded immediately and the special

 condition defined in the T/R rules of the J31.1 message is satisfied.

 i. The J31.0 and J31.1 messages use standard Receipt/Compliance

 procedures. However, an additional J31.1 Receipt/Compliance message is

 required to indicate successful or unsuccessful loading of the

 cryptovariable. As noted above, the terminal provides an R/C response to the

 J31.0 (ACT = 6) Packed OTAR message, and in the same time slot includes the

 J31.1 (ACT = 6) message with values in each field of the J31.1 which are

 unchanged from those received. The terminal does not provide an R/C response

 for the J31.0 (ACT = 7) Packed OTMR message or for the J31.1 (ACT = 7) that

 follows it in the same time slot.


-----

###### 4.3 PRECISE PARTICIPANT LOCATION AND IDENTIFICATION

 The PPLI function uses J2 PPLI messages to provide network participation

 status, identification, and position of JUs, PUs, and RUs on the Link 16

 interface. The J2 messages also contain information on relative navigation

 that allows JUs to accurately determine their position. The J2.0 Indirect

 Interface Unit PPLI messages on PUs and RUs shall not be used for relative

 navigation computation.

 The J2 messages shall be transmitted on the PPLI Network PG using the

 specified access mode and relayed using paired slot relay (conditional or

 unconditional) as assigned to participating platforms (see paragraph

 4.2.3.10.4).

 The PPLI function must be implemented by all JUs.

 4.3.1 UNIT PARTICIPATION STATUS ON LINK 16

 Each IU may need to know, on a dynamic basis, the participation status of any

 other units on the interface, i.e., JUs, PUs, or RUs. The J2 messages

 provide the means for exchanging participation status information on Link 16.

 The NPS IND shall be set appropriately as described in paragraph 4.2.6.3.

 4.3.2 PARTICIPANT IDENTIFICATION

 The identification of an IU is provided by the following information in the

 J2 messages:

 a. Environment/Category of an IU.

 b. Classification of the unit as a nonC[2] JU, C[2] JU, PU, or RU.

 c. Type of indirect IU.

 d. Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature

 (IFF/SIF) information on the IU when available.


-----

###### e. Platform and Platform Activity of the IU when available. Platform

 Activity will be that which is currently being conducted.

 f. Strength of an IU.

 g. Mission Commander status. Transmitted in the J2.2I word by a nonC[2]

 JU participating in an ASO mission, and assigned as Mission Commander.

 4.3.2.1 ENVIRONMENT/CATEGORY OF AN INTERFACE UNIT

 In the PPLI message, the environment/category of an IU is indicated by the

 message sublabel as follows:

 a. Sublabel 0 - Indirect Interface Unit (Link 11/11B).

 b. Sublabel 2 - Air.

 c. Sublabel 3 - Surface (Maritime).

 d. Sublabel 4 - Subsurface (Maritime).

 e. Sublabel 5 - Land (Ground) Point.

 f. Sublabel 6 - Land (Ground) Track.

 4.3.2.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AN INTERFACE UNIT

 The classification of an IU as either a nonC[2] JU or a C[2] JU is indicated by
 the C[2] indicator.

 4.3.2.3 TYPE OF INDIRECT INTERFACE UNIT

 For indirect interface units, the J2.0 message provides the Originator

 Environment/Category (Surface (Maritime), Subsurface (Maritime), Land

 (Ground) Air) type of site (PU, RU, FPU/FRU), and Unit Type (e.g., Tactical

 Air Operation Center (TAOC), Message Processing Center (MPC), Control and

 Reporting Center (CRC), etc.). The Source TN field in the Header word that


-----

###### accompanies each J2.0 message will contain the TN associated with the

 forwarded unit.

 4.3.2.4 TRANSPONDER DATA

 For those IUs capable of responding to IFF/SIF interrogations, the applicable

 J2 IFF/SIF continuation word shall contain the same IFF/SIF modes and codes

 transmitted by the IU's transponder.

 4.3.2.5 STRENGTH OF AN INTERFACE UNIT

 The strength of an IU is provided in the Strength field, which indicates the

 number of similar units/objects (which could include other JTIDS/MIDS
 equipped units not currently reporting their own PPLI) that are located with

 the reporting IU, including the reporting IU.

 4.3.2.6 EXERCISE INDICATOR

 In the PPLI message, the Exercise Indicator is used to provide the capability

 to distinguish IUs that are participating in an exercise from those with a

 nonexercise mission. When the Exercise Indicator field is set to value 1 in

 the J2 series PPLI message, it shall be interpreted to mean that all data

 concerning the IU must be considered artificial, for exercise purposes,

 except that the following data shall not be artificial:

 a. Track Number.

 b. Position and Movement: Latitude, Longitude, Altitude/Elevation/

 Depth, Course, Speed.

 c. Simulation Indicator.

 d. Network Management Data: All J0, J1, and J31 data, the J2.XI

 Active Relay Indicator and Network Participation Status Indicator, and the

 two Active Relay Indicators in the J2.X Mission Information continuation

 words.


-----

###### e. RELNAV Data: RTT messages, all J2.XC3 data, and J2.XI RTT Reply

 Status Indicator, Time Quality, and Geodetic Position Quality.

 J13.2 Air Platform and System Status message.

 h. Flight Deck Status, Landing/Approach Condition, and associated Time

 Report Function, Minute and Hour, in the J13.3 Surface (Maritime) Platform

 and System Status message.

 4.3.3 PARTICIPANT LOCATION

 The location of all IUs and, if applicable, the altitude/elevation of the

 JTIDS/MIDS antenna shall be provided by geodetic coordinates in the J2

 messages. If the unit is a JU, the location and altitude/elevation reported

 shall be that of the JTIDS/MIDS antenna. Additionally, mobile IUs shall

 report course and speed.

 PU or RU locations are reported in J2.0 messages by FJUs.

 The location of the JU's antenna is contained in that JU's J2 message in the

 extension word. This is normally the location of the JU. If the JU is not

 collocated with the antenna, the Displaced Position Indicator shall be set in

 that JU's J2 message and the applicable J2 Displaced Position continuation

 word shall indicate the JU's actual location.

 The applicable J2 UTM/UPS Position continuation word shall be used by JUs

 appropriately equipped to transmit Universal Transverse Mercator

 (UTM)/Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grid coordinates. The geodetic

 position in the extension word may be used for Relative Navigation.

 4.3.3.1 PPLI REPORTING BY JUs

 Each JU shall transmit an appropriate J2 PPLI message on the PPLI Network PG,

 in the specified access mode, at least once per time interval. The time


-----

###### interval is defined as the maximum time differential between PPLI reports
 that allows C[2] JUs to maintain other JUs with active status. The location of

 moving JUs shall be extrapolated to the time of transmission. To maintain an

 active status on a JU, at least one PPLI must be received every 40-60
 seconds, or the JU will be considered inactive. In the latter case, C[2] JUs may

 delete the track or begin transmitting a surveillance track (based on own

 sensor data, or as a nonreal-time track). For surveillance purposes (see

 paragraph 4.4.2.2.1), J2.x messages shall be transmitted periodically in

 accordance with the appropriate J2.x message Transmit Rules.

 4.3.3.2 PPLI REPORTING OF FORWARDED IUs

 An FJU shall transmit a J2.0 message on the PPLI Network PG, using the

 specified access mode, at least once per time interval for each IU which is

 being forwarded. The time interval for the reporting of forwarded units

 shall be the same as specified in paragraph 4.3.3.1 above. The TN, Identity

 (ID), location, and amplifying information shall be identical to the latest

 information received from the forwarded unit on the other link. The location

 of moving forwarded units may be extrapolated to the time of transmission.

 4.3.4 RELATIVE NAVIGATION

 Relative Navigation is a terminal function that provides JUs with accurate

 position information within a common frame of reference. The function

 incorporates two basic coordinate systems, the standard geodetic system using

 latitude and longitude coordinates as defined by the WGS-84 Standard, and a

 relative rectilinear planar (U, V) grid tangent to the earth's surface at a

 selectable grid origin point. Accurate relative position data are developed

 in the U, V grid by the JTIDS/MIDS terminal. When two or more of these

 terminals have an accurate, independently derived knowledge of their geodetic

 position, the Relative Navigation function provides all terminals with

 accurate geodetic position.

 A Beta Angle is computed by each JU participating in the Relative Navigation

 grid. Each JU's relative navigation algorithm shall determine its best

 estimate of the angular difference between the V axis of the grid and true

 north. This estimate will be based on the information presented to the


-----

###### algorithm via received PPLI messages and the individual platform's navigation

 information provided to the algorithm. Each JU (including NCs and PRs) shall

 transmit its own estimate of Beta Angle in accordance with the T/R rules

 established.

 4.3.4.1 ORGANIZATION

 For purposes of operating the Relative Navigation function, the JTIDS/MIDS

 network consists of the following types of JUs forming an organizational

 hierarchy as follows:

 a. Network Time Reference.

 b. Position References.

 c. Navigation Controllers.

 d. Primary Users.

 e. Secondary Users.

 Every JU implementing the Relative Navigation function is capable of

 operating as one or more of these types of elements.

 4.3.4.1.1 NETWORK TIME REFERENCE

 A single JU is designated to be the time reference for the network. The NTR

 serves as the basic reference for system time, as specified in the JTIDS/MIDS

 technical characteristics, Section 3, Terms and Definitions. The NTR may

 also be designated simultaneously as a PR and/or a NC.

 4.3.4.1.2 POSITION REFERENCE

 One or more JUs that maintain a geodetic position accuracy of 50 feet, l

 sigma, over long periods of time, including the NTR and the NC, may be

 designated as a PR. PRs may be fixed, ground based elements whose geodetic

 positions have been surveyed accurately; fixed or mobile surface or airborne

 elements that derive geodetic position accurately through independent


-----

###### navigation systems, e.g., GPS and inertial navigation; or fixed elements that

 have determined geodetic position accurately after participating in the

 system for some period of time below the level of the PR and whose

 designation is changed manually to that of the PR. PRs are not essential to

 the operation of the Relative Navigation function. In the absence of PRs,

 the function continues to provide geodetic position based upon a weighted

 best fit computation of own unit's navigation system input, RELNAV TOA

 measurements, and remote unit's geodetic positions reported in PPLI messages. 

 When a PR is present the computed Qpg of own unit may have a higher quality

 than when there is no PR.

 4.3.4.1.3 NAVIGATION CONTROLLER

 To establish the relative grid coordinate system (U, V), at least one JU is

 designated as a NC. If the navigation controller is a moving JU, there may

 or may not be one other navigation controller either stationary or moving. 

 If a stationary JU is selected as the navigation controller, one other

 stationary or moving JU that knows its distance accurately relative to the

 first JU must also be designated as a navigation controller. The NTR or a PR

 may be designated simultaneously as a NC. The NCs establish the origin of

 the relative U, V grid and the north orientation of the grid. If there is a

 single airborne NC, the north orientation of the grid is referenced to the

 dead reckoner of the NC. If there are two stationary NCs, the north

 orientation of the grid is determined by the relative positions of the two

 NCs.

 4.3.4.1.4 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY USERS

 All system JUs not assigned as the NTR, PRs, or NCs shall be either Primary

 or Secondary Users.

 a. Primary Users use the Active mode to achieve and maintain fine

 synchronization as specified in the JTIDS/MIDS technical characteristics,

 Section 3, Terms and Definitions. Since this procedure requires transmission

 of RTT Interrogations, the particular JUs to be designated as Primary Users

 and the number of JUs so designated in the total environment must consider

 the availability of time slots to be used for this purpose. A JU cannot be

 designated as a Primary User if operating in the Radio Silence mode.


-----

###### b. Secondary Users normally use the Passive mode to achieve

 synchronization as specified in the JTIDS/MIDS technical characteristics,

 Section 3, Terms and Definitions. However, this does not preclude the use of

 the Active mode under conditions of poor geometry.

 4.3.4.2 CAPACITY

 The subscriber capacity of the Relative Navigation function is unlimited. 

 JUs determine position solely on the basis of the received position, the TOA

 information, and available dead reckoner inputs, as illustrated in Figure

 4.3-1. RTT Interrogation by limited numbers of elements (PRs, NCs, and

 Primary Users) is acceptable; however, the use of RTT Interrogation is not a

 requirement for operation of the JTIDS/MIDS Relative Navigation function. 

 Purely passive relative navigation, as well as initial network entry and

 synchronization, are possible.

 4.3.4.3 POSITION ACCURACY

 Position accuracy achieved through Relative Navigation is a complex function

 of measurement and computation of errors (source time and position errors),

 geometrical dilution of precision, and dead reckoner accuracy. Under optimum

 conditions, a JU is capable of position location to an accuracy of l00 feet

 root mean square.


-----

###### Figure 4.3-1. Position Location Using Time-of-Arrival Data


-----

###### 4.3.4.4 INPUT REQUIREMENTS

 The Relative Navigation function performs all computations necessary for

 synchronizing and determining a JU's position and velocity using J2 and RTT

 messages received from the Link 16 interface and inputs from altimeter and

 dead reckoner equipment, e.g., barometric altimeter, inertial navigation

 systems, Doppler radar, attitude and heading reference, airspeed, and

 magnetic compass.

 4.3.4.5 GRID ACQUISITION AND CONVERGENCE

 It is possible for a terminal to begin Relative Navigation with an initial

 position estimate error of 25 nautical miles or less. With a 12-second J2

 message reporting cycle by three sources providing good geometry, the time to

 converge to the accuracy specified in paragraph 4.3.4.3 is less than five

 minutes.

 4.3.4.6 GEODETIC REFERENCE

 All geodetic computations use WGS-84 geoid parameters for equatorial radius

 (6,378,l37 meters) and flattening (l/298.257223563). Coordinate conversions

 to WGS-84 from geodetic references that use other coordinate systems are as

 specified in the individual system segment specifications.

 4.3.4.7 FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION

 Control of source-user relationships is based on the estimated accuracy of

 synchronism and position derived within the filter algorithms of each

 terminal and reflected in the J2 messages by the four data fields denoted

 Time Quality (Qt), Geodetic Position Quality (Qpg), Relative Position Quality

 (Qpr), and Relative Azimuth Quality (Qar). These fields indicate the

 terminal's accuracy in its latest estimate of system time and the accuracy of

 its estimate of position reported in that J2 message.

 The NTR transmits a Qt of 15 and does not adjust its local terminal clock. 

 Any terminal, except those in the Conditional Radio Silence or Polling mode,

 is capable of operating as the NTR. PRs transmit a Qpg of 15 and do not

 perform adjustments to their geodetic position on the basis of TOA


-----

###### observations. NCs transmit a Qpr set to value of 15, Qar set to value 7, and

 define the origin and orientation of the relative rectilinear planar (U, V)

 grid tangent to the grid at the origin and do not perform adjustments to

 relative grid position on the basis of TOA observations. The NC adjusts its

 geodetic position and velocity on the basis of messages received from

 terminals having higher values of Qpg, including, but not limited to, PRs. 

 Primary and Secondary User distinction is related to the methods of

 synchronization and associated source selection rules.

 4.3.4.8 FINE SYNCHRONIZATION

 Each terminal is capable of achieving Fine Synchronization by three modes

 designated Active RTT, Passive I and Passive II.

 Initial Entry and Coarse Synchronization precede Fine Synchronization. Choice

 of the Active RTT, Passive I, or Passive II mode is determined by assignment

 of the JU as an NTR, PR, NC, Primary User, or Secondary User. In the Active

 RTT mode of synchronization, the interrogated unit responds with an RTT Reply

 containing the information required to allow the synchronizing unit to

 perform radio link time corrections. A continuing series of such RTT events

 is used to maintain clock offset, drift rate (frequency error), and estimated

 accuracy of synchronization. The Active RTT mode of synchronization is used

 exclusively by PRs, NCs and Primary Users and, under certain conditions, by

 Secondary Users.

 In the Passive I mode of synchronization, the local clock offset and drift

 rate are computed by passive observations of the TOAs of J2 messages from

 other terminals. The Passive I mode of operation compensates for signal

 propagation time by computation of distance from the source J2 message and

 own unit positional data. The Passive I mode of operation requires a

 knowledge of own unit position independent of Relative Navigation and allows

 a terminal to achieve Fine Synchronization.

 In the Passive II mode of synchronization the local clock offset and drift

 rate are computed from passive observations of a set of J2 message TOA values

 from geographically separated sources. The Passive II mode of

 synchronization shall not require prior knowledge of own unit position other


-----

###### than an approximate initial estimate required to start recursive filter

 operations.

 4.3.4.9 SOURCE SELECTION AND QUALITY FIELD VALUES

 Each terminal determines and transmits in its J2 messages the following

 quality fields as defined in the JTIDS/MIDS characteristics, Section 3, Terms

 and Definitions.

 a. Time Quality.

 b. Geodetic Position Quality.

 c. Relative Position Quality.

 d. Relative Azimuth Quality.

 The values of the quality fields transmitted in the terminal J2 messages are

 as a direct function of the variances computed by the recursive filter

 operations of the Relative Navigation function. The source selection

 criteria, observation weighting functions, filter gains and time constants,

 and own-unit quality setting computations are such that each navigating unit

 tends to advance in quality so as to operate on the minimum set of highest

 quality sources capable of supplying the geometrical requirements necessary

 to support own unit quality. Increases in variances caused by deterioration

 of geometry or loss of observations will cause a decrease in quality and

 subsequent selection of previously inferior sources to restore geometry and

 stability at a new, lower quality.

 The source selection algorithms are fully automatic and adaptive, requiring

 no prior knowledge or preloading of source identities, and provide a

 hierarchical structure to prevent circulation (feedback) of errors. Units of

 inferior time or position accuracy do not degrade the accuracy of superior

 units. The source selection algorithms specified in the terminal are

 intended to define the maximum set of allowable sources. They are not

 intended to be sufficient to assure optimum performance in all platforms.


-----

###### More restrictive criteria are used when necessary for the maintenance of

 performance in communities of units of divergent performance capabilities. 

 If unable to process inputs from all sources acceptable under the basic

 source selection rule, e.g., through lack of computer program operating time,

 additional source selection logic may be used to choose a subset of those

 inputs. However, this additional logic does not result in time and position

 qualities inferior by more than one quality level to that obtainable by

 processing the best equal-sized subset. In addition to the quality-based

 source selection criteria, all terminals reject from relative navigation and

 synchronization processing all relayed and simulated messages. Relayed J2

 messages, however, may be used for direct acquisition of the U, V grid

 origin.

 4.3.4.9.1 NETWORK TIME REFERENCE

 The JU designated as the NTR sets Qt to value 15 and performs no radio link

 time corrections. The NTR, if not also a PR or NC, selects as sources for

 relative and geodetic updates those satisfying at least the following

 criteria. Letting sQt, sQpr and sQpg denote source qualities in received J2

 messages, and Qt, Qpr and Qpg denote own unit qualities, the first level

 selection criterion for relative filter update by ranging is the satisfaction

 of the following two conditions:

 a. sQt is greater than or equal to Qpr.

 b. sQpr is greater than or equal to Qpr.

 Geodetic filter updates are made by either of two techniques, ranging or

 direct acquisition of grid origin data. Source data are processed for

 geodetic update by ranging only if the following three conditions are

 satisfied:

 a. sQpg is greater than or equal to Qpg.

 b. sQt is greater than or equal to Qpg.

 c. sQt is not equal to 0.


-----

###### Sources for direct acquisition of grid origin data are selected only if

 either of the following sets of conditions is satisfied:

 a. sQpg is greater than Qpg.

 b. sQpr is greater than Qpg.

 c. Qpr is greater than Qpg.

          Or

 d. sQpr is greater than Qpr.

 e. sQpg is greater than Qpr.

 f. Qpg is greater than Qpr.

 Direct acquisition of the improved grid origin estimate is used to update

 geodetic position if Qpg is less than Qpr or to update relative position if Qpg

 is greater than Qpr. In either case, the inferior own unit position quality

 shall be set no greater than the least of the other three position qualities

 following the update.

 4.3.4.9.2 POSITION REFERENCE

 Units designated as PRs must have a geodetic position accuracy of less than

 or equal to 50 feet, set Qpg to value 15 and do not make geodetic updates. 

 PRs use the Active RTT mode of synchronization. RTT Interrogations are

 transmitted in the next available transmit opportunity following that time

 update cycle in which the computed time variance exceeds a threshold computed

 from the time quality of the best available time source. The time variance

 threshold is computed each update cycle from the following relationship or by

 the equivalent interpolation in Table 4.3-TBD.

 σ 2th = 5000 2[14-(]sQt-A)

  where:

 σ 2th = threshold time variance


-----

s[Q]t[  = the highest time quality observed in any PPLI message ]

###### received during the preceding time filter cycle time

 A  = 0.5, a variable parameter, (0.1-0.9, 0.1)

 The RTT Interrogation is addressed to the source used in the threshold

 computation. Upon completion of clock update, time quality is determined as

 specified in the JTIDS/MIDS technical characteristics, Section 3, Terms and

 Definitions, for the updated value of time variance. In time filter cycles

 not requiring an RTT Interrogation, the time variance increases according to

 the filtering and estimation algorithm model of the expected clock error. 

 Failure to receive an RTT Reply to three consecutive interrogations of the

 same source causes that source to be rejected from the threshold computation. 

 In any event, no more than l0% of total assigned capacity is used for RTT

 Interrogations.

 PRs may acquire grid origin information by direct acquisition from sources

 satisfying the selection criteria specified for the NTR in paragraph

 4.3.4.9.l. For PRs, these criteria automatically result in updates to

 relative position and relative position quality only. Relative position

 update may also be derived from range measurements using the same source

 selection criteria specified for the NTR in paragraph 4.3.4.9.l.

 4.3.4.9.3 NAVIGATION CONTROLLER

 The NC sets Qpr to value 15 and Qar to value 7 and performs no relative grid

 navigation computations from TOA observations. If not also the NTR, the NC

 synchronizes with RTT Interrogations using the same source selection,

 threshold and time quality logic specified for PRs in paragraph 4.3.4.9.2. 

 Initially, the NC may arbitrarily specify the geodetic coordinates of the

 relative grid origin. The NC may refine the estimate of grid origin by

 either of two means of geodetic update. Geodetic update may be performed by

 ranging on other elements satisfying the following three source selection

 criteria:

 a. sQpg is greater than or equal to Qpg.

 b. sQt is greater than or equal to Qpg.


-----

###### c. sQt is not equal to 0.

 Qpg is updated each cycle in accordance with the quality and variance

 relationships as specified in the JTIDS technical characteristics, Section 3,

 Terms and Definitions. The NC is also capable of receiving improved grid

 origin estimates by direct acquisition from other units navigating in the

 relative grid. These sources are selected by the logic specified for the NTR

 in paragraph 4.3.4.9.1.

 4.3.4.9.4 PRIMARY USERS

 Primary Users synchronize by RTT using the same source selection and

 threshold logic as that specified for Position References in paragraph

 4.3.4.9.2. Primary Users select for Relative Navigation ranging observations

 those sources that satisfy the following two conditions:

 a. sQt is greater than or equal to Qpr.

 b. sQpr is greater than or equal to Qpr.

 Primary Users select sources for geodetic update using the same logic as the

 NC as specified in paragraph 4.3.4.9.3. Primary Users select sources for

 grid origin acquisition by the same criteria as those of the NTR, as

 specified in paragraph 4.3.4.9.l. Primary users compute and report own unit

 position qualities in the same manner as the NTR.

 4.3.4.9.5 SECONDARY USERS

 Secondary Users normally perform synchronization and Relative Navigation

 passively. Users operating in the Radio Silence mode shall automatically

 perform as Secondary Users; however, use of the passive modes of

 synchronization and Relative Navigation is not limited to the Radio Silence

 mode and is selectable at any time by operator entry.

 Secondary Users select as sources for passive update of both time and

 relative position qualities JUs having better than own unit time and greater

 than own unit relative position qualities. Combined passive time and

 geodetic position updates are made only with J2 messages having better time


-----

###### and greater geodetic position qualities greater than own unit. Selection of

 operation as a Secondary User does not, except when operating in the Radio

 Silence mode, preclude the use of RTT to augment the basic passive modes

 under conditions of poor geometry or for initial entry. Sources for position

 updates include only those having both time and position qualities greater

 than the lesser of own unit time or position quality.

 As with Primary Users, the addressee of the RTT Interrogation shall be the

 unit of highest time quality. When in poor geometry, Secondary Users shall

 generate RTT Interrogations only as often as required to maintain own unit

 time variance as a negligible contribution to the position variance. RTT

 Interrogations by Secondary Users shall occur no more frequently than once

 per epoch. Secondary Users shall select sources for direct acquisition of

 grid origin by the same criteria as the NTR, as specified in paragraph

 4.3.4.9.1.

 4.3.4.9.6 TIME OF ARRIVAL ONLY

 Mobile JUs having no dead reckoner inputs shall employ filter algorithms that

 are capable of determining relative position solely on the basis of TOA

 measurements and J2 messages from other JUs. They shall otherwise comply

 with paragraphs 4.3.4.9 and 4.3.4.9.l. The design of the terminal logic is

 such that the reported position quality reflects a conservative estimate of

 position accuracy.

 4.3.4.10 RELATIVE NAVIGATION CORRECTION TO HOST SYSTEM

###### 4.4 SURVEILLANCE

 There is a requirement to exchange surveillance information on the Link 16

 network. This section describes the exchange of surveillance information

 using fixed format messages.

 C[2] JUs participating in the exchange of J3 Surveillance messages shall

 transmit surveillance information in Network PGs as defined in paragraph
 4.2.3.10.5. NonC[2] JUs shall receive situational awareness information from

 the Surveillance NPG including track and Reference Point data necessary to
 support the platform mission. NonC[2] JUs shall not transmit on the

 Surveillance NPG. The following paragraphs specify the general rules and

 conventions necessary to satisfy the exchange requirements for surveillance

 data.

 4.4.1 SURVEILLANCE DATA

 Surveillance information includes the following data:

 a. Point surveillance data included in the J3.0 Reference Point

 message and the J3.1 Emergency Point message.

 b. Air and Surface (Maritime) surveillance data included in the J3.2

 Air Track message and the J3.3 Surface (Maritime) Track message.

 Paragraph 5.7.1 describes the requirement for initial transmission and

 explains the way message redundancy is specified. Each message contains the

 special rules required for the transmission and reception of that message.

 The general rules and conventions common to the entire Surveillance function

 are defined in paragraph 4.4.2. Subsequent paragraphs describe the rules and

 conventions for reporting Point surveillance data (paragraph 4.4.3), Air,

 Surface (Maritime), and Land (Ground) surveillance data (paragraph 4.4.4),

 Subsurface (Maritime) surveillance data (paragraph 4.4.5), Space and

 Ballistic Missile surveillance data (paragraph 4.4.6), and EW surveillance

 data (paragraph 4.4.7).

 4.4.2 GENERAL RULES AND CONVENTIONS

 The general rules and conventions for reporting surveillance data are

 described in the following paragraphs.


-----

###### 4.4.2.1 IDENTITY

 Standard identity is provided in terms of the following definitions:

 a. Pending - A track which has not been subjected to the

 identification process.

 b. Unknown - An evaluated track which has not been identified.

 c. Assumed Friend - A track which is assumed to be a friend because of

 its characteristics, behavior, or origin.

 d. Friend - A track belonging to a declared friendly nation.

 e. Neutral - A track whose characteristics, behavior, origin, or

 nationality indicate that it is neither supporting nor opposing friendly

 forces.

 f. Suspect - A track which is potentially hostile because of its

 characteristics, behavior, origin or nationality.

 g. Hostile - A track declared to belong to any opposing nation, party,

 group, or entity, which by virtue of its behavior or information collected on

 it such as characteristics, origin or nationality contributes to the threat

 to friendly forces.

 These standard identity terms are further amplified by the Special Interest

 Indicator, Exercise Indicator and Identity Amplifying Descriptor, Specific

 Type, Platform, Platform Activity, and Identity Confidence fields.

 4.4.2.1.1 EXERCISE TRACKS

 There is a requirement to distinguish between live tracks that are involved

 in an exercise and other live tracks being reported. This is accomplished by

 setting the Exercise Indicator in the J3 track messages. Only tracks with

 standard identity of Friend can be modified by the exercise identity. When

 the Exercise Indicator is set to value 0, Non-Exercise Track, the standard

 identity of the track shall be specified in the Identity field. When the


-----

###### Exercise Indicator is set to value 1, Exercise Track, the standard identity

 of the track shall be Friend and the exercise identity shall be specified in

 the Identity Amplifying Descriptor field. The Identity Amplifying Descriptor

 field shall not be set unless the Exercise Indicator field is set to value 1,

 Exercise Track. In particular, a track with the Exercise Indicator set to

 value 1, Exercise Track, and the Identity Amplifying Descriptor set to value

 6, FAKER, shall be identified as a friendly track acting as a hostile for

 exercise purposes. Also, a track with the Exercise Indicator set to value 1,

 Exercise Track, and the Identity Amplifying Descriptor set to value 5, JOKER,

 shall be identified as a friendly track acting as a suspect for exercise

 purposes. For any track with Exercise Indicator set to value 1, Exercise

 Track, data concerning the track must be considered artificial, for exercise

 purposes, except that the following shall not be artificial:

 a. Track Number.

 b. Tracking Data: Latitude, Longitude, Altitude/Elevation/Depth,

 Course, Speed, Minute, Hour, and Track Quality.

 c. Simulation Indicator.

 d. Environment/Category.

 e. Status Data on Air Tracks: Fuel Function, Fuel, Time Report

 Function, Minute, and Hour.

 f. Status Data on Surface (Maritime) Tracks: Flight Deck Status,

 Landing/Approach Condition, and associated Time Report Function, Minute and

 Hour.

 4.4.2.1.2 SPECIAL INTEREST TRACKS

 A track's identity can be further amplified by designating it as a track of

 special interest. This is accomplished by setting the identity field as

 appropriate and by setting the special interest indicator. Examples of

 employment of this indicator are:

 a. Kilo/Yoke - A friendly track of special interest.


-----

###### b. Zombie - A SUSPECT air track conforming to ATC rules or outside

 NATO airspace following a recognized traffic pattern.

 c. Traveller - A SUSPECT surface track following a recognized traffic

 route.

 4.4.2.1.3 PLATFORM AND PLATFORM ACTIVITY

 The Platform and Platform Activity fields are Environment/Category dependent

 and serve to further amplify the identity of the reported track in specific

 terms, such as fighter, close air support.

 4.4.2.1.4 IDENTITY CONFIDENCE

 Identity Confidence (ID CON) criteria are yet to be determined (baseline to

 be determined by common agreement between Allied Nations).

 4.4.2.1.5 SPECIFIC TYPE

 Specific type is Environment/Category dependent and serves to further amplify

 platforms in each Environment/Category. Specific type is normally provided

 by status report from interface units or by intelligence amplification

 reports on surveillance tracks, or in the J3.2, J3.3, J3.4, J3.5, and J3.6

 messages.

 4.4.2.1.6 SHIPBORNE MISSILE SYSTEMS

 The surface-to-air (SAM) and/or surface-to-surface (SSM) missile systems

 fitted in surface (maritime) units may be reported in the J3.3 Surface

 (Maritime) Track message or the J6.0 Amplification message.

 4.4.2.2 REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY

 Surveillance data reporting is initiated by the JU which first detects or

 initiates a track/point and makes it available for reporting on the

 interface. Each track/point initiated and reported shall be assigned a TN
 from the JU's allocated block. At that time, the JU shall have R[2] for the
 track/point. R[2] procedures for Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land (Ground)


-----

###### surveillance tracks are discussed in paragraph 4.4.4.11. The general R[2] rules
 for points are discussed in paragraph 4.4.3.2, the R[2] rules for Ballistic
 Missile surveillance tracks are discussed in paragraph 4.4.6.15, and the R[2]

 rules for EW Surveillance are discussed in paragraph 4.4.7.2.

 4.4.2.2.1 INTEGRATION OF PPLI REPORTS WITH SURVEILLANCE DATA

 PPLI data available from J2 messages shall be used by C[2] JUs to reduce the

 redundancy of surveillance track reporting.

 a. A surveillance JU will accept the PPLI information into its

 surveillance database and perform the applicable correlation and conflict

 processing necessary to ensure that duplicative information is not being

 transmitted on the Surveillance Network PG.

 b. A C[2] JU participating on the Surveillance Network PG shall attempt

 to correlate received PPLI reports with data being received from local
 sensors. If a correlation is found with a track for which the C[2] JU has R[2]

 the J7.2 Correlation message shall be transmitted with the Response Value

 (RV) field set to value 1 (Reverse Correlation Not Acceptable), and with the

 Source TN in the Header word of the J2 PPLI message as the Retained TN and
 the surveillance TN as the Dropped TN. The C[2] JU shall cease reporting the

 track and transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 0) Drop Track message on the surveillance

 TN.

 c. If a correlation is found with a track for which another C[2] JU has
 R[2] and the TNs are different, the J7.2 (RV = 1) Correlation message shall be

 transmitted, with the Source TN in the Header word of the J2 PPLI message as

 the Retained TN and the surveillance TN as the Dropped TN.

 d. If a correlation is found with a track for which another C[2] JU has
 R[2] and the TNs are the same, the JU receiving the J2 shall accept the PPLI

 information into its surveillance database and shall disregard the J3

 surveillance data on the specified track except when Geodetic Position

 Quality in the PPLI message is set to value 0, in which case the surveillance

 track is accepted and the PPLI message shall be discarded.

 e. Subsurface tracks shall not be correlated with IUs.


-----

###### f. If a correlation is not found, the C[2] JU shall integrate the

 received J2 PPLI report into its surveillance database as part of the

 surveillance picture. If J2 messages are not received subsequent to this
 action and the receiving C[2] JU still has no local data, the C[2] JU assumes no

 responsibility for reporting the subject JU on the Surveillance Network PG.

 g. If the position or other data in a PPLI meet a system's

 decorrelation criteria, the PPLI and local track data shall be decorrelated. 
 After decorrelation, the C[2] JU shall initiate a surveillance track report with

 locally held data using a new track number. The PPLI Track Number and

 Identity Indicator field and the PPLI IFF/SIF Indicator field shall both be

 reported as No Statement.

 4.4.2.2.2 REPORTING OF INACTIVE AND LIMITED STATUS INTERFACE UNITS

 A C[2] JU shall assume R[2] of an IU (including C[2] and nonC[2] JUs and forwarded PUs

 and RUs) in accordance with the reporting rules for a real-time track if the
 C[2] JU has correlated local sensor data, when:

 a. A J2 PPLI message is not received for 40 to 60 seconds, or

 b. A J2 PPLI message, other than J2.0, is received with the NPS

 Indicator set to Inactive or Conditional Radio Silence, or

 c. A J7.0 (ACT = 0) Drop Track message is received from the FJU for a

 PU, RU, or other IU, or

 d. The Geodetic Position Quality in the J2 PPLI message is set to

 value 0.

 A C[2] JU assuming R[2] of an IU reports it as a track or point on the

 Surveillance Network PG. The type of surveillance message will depend upon

 the Environment/Category of the IU being reported. The Identity shall be

 reported as Friend. The Track Number, Platform and Platform Activity values

 received in previous PPLI messages shall be reported. The PPLI Track Number

 and Identity Indicator shall be reported as value 1, and shall be maintained
 if another C[2] JU assumes R[2] of the IU.


-----

###### The PPLI Track Number and Identity Indicator, when set to value 1, serves

 several useful purposes. For example, in addition to the uses defined in

 Paragraph 4.7, it may displayed to operators to give an extra measure of

 confidence in the track identification data being reported.

 The most current IFF/SIF data shall be reported. If all IFF/SIF nonzero mode

 codes were obtained from or are the same as the codes received in the J2

 message for the subject TN, the PPLI IFF/SIF Indicator in the J3 message

 shall be reported as value 2. Otherwise, if the Mode II code was obtained

 from or is the same as the Mode II code received in the J2 message, the PPLI

 IFF/SIF Indicator shall be reported as value 1. Otherwise, the PPLI IFF/SIF

 Indicator shall be reported as value 0. The Mode IV Indicator value reported

 shall be based on actual responses received and shall not be based on the

 fact that the TN was previously received in a PPLI message.

 If locally derived IFF/SIF data differs from IFF/SIF data that was being

 reported in the PPLI message, the locally derived data shall be reported.

 4.4.2.3 SIMULATED TRACKS

 There is also a requirement for a capability to indicate that a surveillance

 track is not derived from any sensor data but is a simulated track being

 provided solely for training or test. This is accomplished by setting the

 Simulation Indicator in the appropriate J3 message as well as in the J2

 message when applicable. JUs have the option of implementing simulated

 tracks. JUs also have the option of filtering simulated tracks. The

 Simulation Indicator in the J2 and J3 messages shall be set on all simulated

 tracks when both live and simulated tracks are simultaneously being exchanged

 on the interface. Simulated tracks may be originated from simulated video

 mixed with live video, from message input provided by previously recorded or

 generated messages, or from a TDS's internal simulation program. When the

 Simulation Indicator is set in a J2 or J3 message, all data associated with

 that track are simulated and should not be associated with a live track. 

 Simulated tracks will not be correlated with live tracks. Prior coordination

 with all interface participants is required when transmitting simulated

 tracks on the interface to insure that simulated tracks are not assigned TNs

 from other systems' TN blocks. If a system displays both simulated and live

 tracks simultaneously, the tracks should be readily distinguishable from each


-----

###### other. The Simulation Indicator shall not change. If for any reason, such

 as operator error, it is desired to change the simulation status of a track,

 the track shall be dropped using the J7.0 (ACT = 0) message, and a new track

 shall be reported. The one exception to this rule is that a change from live

 to simulated shall be accepted if the track is being received from an FJU.

 4.4.2.4 SPECIAL PROCESSING AND HANDLING OF SURVEILLANCE DATA

 Special processing of surveillance data may be required in accordance with

 paragraph 4.1.6.

 4.4.2.5 TRACK ALERTS

 Track alerts consist of force tell and emergency alerts. Force Tell and

 Emergency Indicators are provided in the J3 messages to indicate force tell

 and/or emergency conditions. These indicators, when set, allow these

 messages to override all operator controllable data filters. A system with a

 limited track capacity (e.g., F-15) should manage its database to insure that

 it shall not be saturated by force tell and emergency alerts. These

 indicators are set and cleared as specified in paragraph 4.7.1.4.

 4.4.2.6 PURGING

 A JU may have the capability to purge remote tracks/points, i.e.,

 automatically drop a remote track/point after a specified time interval has

 elapsed since the track's/point's last report. The JU shall not transmit a

 J7.0 (ACT = 0) message on a purged remote track/point. See paragraph 4.4.3.7

 Purging of Reference and Land (Ground) Points, paragraph 4.4.3.8 Purging of

 Emergency Points, paragraph 4.4.4.13.2 Purging of Remote Tracks for

 additional information on purging of points and tracks, and paragraph 4.4.7.6

 Termination of Electronic Warfare Surveillance Data, which explains purging

 of EW product information.

 4.4.2.7 RULES FOR "NO STATEMENT" AND "RESET TO NO STATEMENT" VALUES

 Various fields in the J-series messages contain both No Statement and Reset

 to No Statement values. No Statement means the report includes no data for

 that field. It implies nothing about the validity of previously reported


-----

###### non-No Statement data for that field. The Reset value provides a means to

 specifically declare that the currently reported value is incorrect, but the

 correct specific value has not been ascertained. The following rules apply:

 a. When a JU implements the No Statement value and at least one other

 defined value for a field that has a Reset to No Statement value, the Reset

 to No Statement value must also be implemented.

 b. A message reporting the Reset to No Statement value shall be

 transmitted one time.

 c. When a system receives a No Statement value for a field which has a

 Reset to No Statement value and for which a value other than No Statement is

 locally held, the locally held value shall be retained regardless of whether

 it was locally or remotely derived.

 d. When a system receives a Reset to No Statement value, it shall

 automatically revert the locally held value of that field to No Statement.

 e. The Reset to No Statement value may be originated automatically or

 by operator action.

 f. Paragraph 4.6.2 contains amplifying rules for use of the Reset to

 No Statement value in the J6.0 Amplification message.

 4.4.2.8 TRACK NUMBER CONTINUITY

 A particular surveillance entity may be eligible to retain its original Track

 Number on change of report type, Table 4.7-1 specifies those cases when the

 same TN is to be retained and those when a new TN is to be assigned. In
 cases when a new TN is required, the JU with R[2] shall transmit a Drop Track

 Report on the old TN.

 4.4.3 POINT SURVEILLANCE DATA

 Point surveillance data are exchanged as follows:


-----

###### a. J3.0 - Used to exchange tactical information about geographic

 references. (Nonphysical points such as waypoints, Combat Air Patrol (CAP)

 stations, Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA), etc.)

 b. J3.1 - Used to report the existence of an emergency condition

 that requires search and rescue efforts.

 c. J3.5 - Used to report the location of fixed ground units or

 objects. (Physical points such as troop concentrations, bridges, airbases,

 etc.)

 4.4.3.1 POINT, LINE, AND AREA REPORTING

 The J3.0 Reference Point, J3.1 Emergency Point, and the J3.5 Land (Ground)

 Point/Track messages are used to report points, e.g., waypoints, downed

 aircraft, SAM sites, etc. Each point, line, or area reported on the

 interface shall be assigned a TN(s) by the reporting JU, and the position

 shall be reported using geodetic latitude/longitude values. Also, the J3.0

 and J3.5 messages provide the capability to report the altitude/elevation of

 the point, line, or area if required. The capability to report the time

 associated with a reported point, line, or area is provided in all three

 point messages. Time is reported in hours/minutes, and the time meaning is

 defined by the Time Function field. The J3.5 message also provides the

 capability to describe a circle/ellipse about a ground point. This would

 normally be used in reporting a SAM site, but could be used with any J3.5

 point. In addition to reporting points, the capability is provided for the

 J3.0 message to transmit lines such as FEBAs, roads, etc.; areas such as

 search areas, exercise areas, etc.; and volumes such as corridors, etc. 

 Protocols for use of the time and Time Function fields for moving points,

 lines, and areas are contained in paragraph 4.4.3.1.3.

 The J3.0 message word sequences required for support of various point type

 values are provided in the ASW point reporting procedures and associated

 message T/R rules (see paragraph 4.4.5.2.3).

 It is a system option to retain the TN and last reported position of a fixed

 land (ground) IU that has reverted to an inactive status. If the point is


-----

###### required for tactical situation reporting, the JU shall transmit a J3.5

 message on the IU, using the assigned address of the inactive IU.

 There is no interface track-to-point or point-to-point correlation and the

 J7.2 message shall not be used to correlate one track/point with any other

 point. The J7.7 message shall be used to indicate any association between a

 track/point and another track/point.

 It is illegal to change a reference or emergency point to any other type of

 surveillance entity; i.e., the Reference TN used to identify a particular

 reference or emergency point shall not be used for any other type of entity

 reported on the interface except in the normal course of TN reuse. Moreover,

 it is illegal to change the Point Type and/or Point Amplification value of a

 reference point while retaining the same Reference TN. As an exception to

 this rule a Point Amplification value of No Statement may be changed to a

 non-No Statement value and retain the same Reference TN.

 Emergency points are transmitted as J3.1 messages. Emergency points may be

 related to a previously reported track/point. In these cases the J3.1

 message shall contain, as amplifying information, the TN, Previously Reported

 that is associated with the emergency point. The emergency point shall have

 a TN, Reference different from the TN, Previously Reported. When the

 Exercise Indicator is set to value 1 in the J3.1 message, the report is for

 exercise purposes and is not an actual emergency.

 When the J3.0 message is used to report a point, the Point/Line/Area

 Descriptor, 1 field shall be set to value 0, Point, in the initial word.

 4.4.3.1.1 ALTITUDE REPORTING

 When altitude is specified, Altitude, 100 Ft 1 and, if appropriate Altitude,

 100 Ft 2, shall be reported in each J3.0E0 word transmitted. If only one

 altitude is to be reported, the Altitude, 100 Ft 1 shall be used and

 Altitude, 100 Ft 2 shall be set to value 1023, No Statement. When only one

 altitude is provided it is a designated altitude and not at or below and not

 at or above. An altitude range is reported with both Altitude, 100 Ft 1 and

 Altitude, 100 Ft 2. For example, if the altitude to be reported is at or


-----

###### below 10,000 feet, then Altitude, 100 Ft 1 is set to value 0, 0 Altitude and

 Altitude, 100 Ft 2 is set to value 100, 10,000 Feet. If the altitude to be

 reported is at or above 20,000 feet, then Altitude, 100 Ft 1 is set to value

 200, 20,000 Feet and Altitude, 100 Ft 2 is set to value 1022, 102,200 Feet

 (the maximum setting). Altitudes and altitude ranges apply only to a single

 word sequence, i.e., a single track number. This is to allow different

 altitudes to be applied to different segments of the same line.

 4.4.3.1.2 LINES AND AREAS

 The J3.0 message provides for the description of segmented lines, multisided

 areas, squares, rectangles, circles, or ellipses. Volumes are obtained by

 including maximum and minimum altitude values when describing multisided

 areas, squares, rectangles, circles, or ellipses in the J3.0 message.

 a. Segmented Line and Multisided Area Definition. A single J3.0

 message is used to define a segmented line with either 2 or 3 points. 

 Multiple J3.0 messages, each with a unique TN, are used to define segmented

 lines or multisided areas described by more than 3 points. In either case a

 J3.0I/J3.0E0/J3.0C1 word sequence is used for each message. A J3.0C2 word is

 added to the first message if the line or area is moving.

 (1) When 2 or 3 points are joined together to form a segmented

 line, the following conditions are used:

 (a) The Line/Area Continuation Indicator is set to No

 Statement in the initial word of the word sequence.

 (b) The End Point field associated with the appropriate

 coordinates described by one of the two sets of Delta Latitude/Delta

 Longitude fields of the continuation word is set to value 1, End Point.

 (c) The Point/Line/Area Descriptor, 1 field is set to

 value 2, Line, in the initial word.

 (d) The designated reference point from which Delta

 Latitude 1, Delta Longitude 1, Delta Latitude 2, and Delta Longitude 2 are


-----

###### measured is that given by the Latitude and Longitude fields in the J3.0E0

 word.

 (2) When more than 3 points are joined together to form a

 segmented line or a multisided area, the following conditions are used:

 (a) The second and all subsequent messages transmitted

 have the Line/Area Continuation Indicator in the initial word set to value 1,

 Line/Area Continuation.

 (b) The point location described in the extension word of

 the second and all subsequent messages must be the same point location as the

 last point location described in the previous message. This assures a

 receiving unit that it, in fact, received all messages and did not miss a

 transmission.

 (c) The appropriate end point field in the continuation

 word will be set to value 1 to indicate the associated point is the last

 point to be transmitted.

 (d) When describing a multisided area, the last point

 location transmitted must be the same location as the initial point

 transmitted in the first word sequence. This, in effect, closes the figure

 to form an area.

 (e) The designated reference point from which Delta

 Latitude 1, Delta Longitude 1, Delta Latitude 2, and Delta Longitude 2 are

 measured is that given by the Latitude and Longitude fields in the J3.0E0

 word.

 (f) When joining three or more points to form a segmented

 line, the points are first plotted as specified above, then the segments are

 connected in sequence, i.e., the first segment is drawn from the point

 described in the Latitude and Longitude fields in the J3.0E0 word, to the

 point established by the Delta Latitude, 1 and Delta Longitude, 1 fields in

 the J3.0C1 word. The second segment is drawn between the point established

 by the Delta Latitude, 1 and Delta Longitude, 1 fields to that established by


-----

###### the Delta Latitude, 2 and Delta Longitude, 2 fields. This process is

 repeated to connect multiple segments.

 (g) To prevent confusion and possible misunderstanding,

 any change to data concerning any point comprising a portion of a segmented

 line or multisided area, shall cause the entire line or area to be

 transmitted by the reporting JU. Receiving units shall purge the previously

 held segmented line or multisided area and replace it with the new report.

 (h) The TNs used to initiate the segmented line or

 multisided area shall be transmitted for every report of the segmented line
 or multisided area, including a change of R[2].

 (i) The Reference TN of the first J3.0 message with

 Line/Area Continuation Indicator set to value 0 shall be used as the only

 legal identifier for all subsequent references to the segmented line or

 multisided area, except when dropping the line or area (refer to paragraph

 4.4.3.6), setting/clearing the Force Tell Indicator (refer to paragraph

 4.7.1.4.3), or responding to a Data Update Request by TN (refer to paragraph

 4.7.2.1.1).

 (j) The Point/Line/Area Descriptor, 1 field in the initial

 word shall be set to value 2, Line, when describing a segmented line and

 shall be set to value 3, Multi-point Area, when describing a multisided area.

 b. Square, Rectangle, Circles and Ellipse Definition. When defining

 an area that is a square, rectangle, circle, or ellipse a J3.0I/

 J3.0E0/J3.0C2, J3.5I/J3.5E0/J3.5C3, or a J3.7I/J3.7C1/J3.7C2 word sequence is

 used. The Point/Line/Area Descriptor, 1 field in the J3.0I word shall be set

 to value 1, Single Point Area. The Square/Circle Switch field indicates that

 either a square or rectangle is being described when set to value 1 or

 indicates either a circle or ellipse is being described when set to value 2. 

 A square or circle is being described, depending on the value of the

 Square/Circle Switch, when the Area Major Axis and Area Minor Axis fields are

 equal. When the axes are not equal, a rectangle or ellipse is described,

 depending on the value of the Square/Circle Switch. The orientation of the

 major axis with respect to True North is provided by the Axis Orientation

 Field.


-----

###### When defining EW AOPs (refer to paragraph 4.4.7.1.3) the J3.7I/J3.7C1/J3.7C2

 word sequence, as a minimum, is used. The same procedures described above

 are used to define AOPs.

 c. Corridor and Low Level Transit Route (LLTR) Definition. Corridors

 are reported using Point Type value 4, Line and Point Amplification value 3,

 Corridor. LLTRs are reported using Point Type value 4, Line and Point

 Amplification value 6, Low Level Transit Route. Both of these lines are

 center lines and may be single or segmented with altitude(s) associated with

 each segment. Width is reported in the Area Major Axis, 4 field in the

 J3.0C5 word. All other fields in the J3.0C5 word shall be set to No

 Statement.

 4.4.3.1.3 SLAVED POINTS AND AREAS

 a. Certain reference points and areas may be slaved in a constant

 position in relation to a Related TN. The position of a slaved point or area

 is established as Delta Latitude, 1/Delta Longitude, 1 from the Related TN at

 the time of the report when the Slaved Indicator is set to value 1. This

 establishes the constant true or relative bearing and range of the slaved

 point or area from the Related TN. The absence or presence of the J3.0C4

 word indicates whether slaving is on a true or relative bearing, as described

 in paragraph 4.4.3.1.2e below. If the J3.0E0 word is included in a report of

 a slaved point or area, Latitude, 0.0103 Minute and Longitude, 0.0103 Minute

 shall be set to No Statement. An example of a slaved point is a marshall

 point used during aircraft recovery operations aboard an aircraft carrier.

 b. When a square or rectangle (Square/Circle Switch = 1) or a circle

 or ellipse (Square/Circle Switch = 2) is slaved, the position established by

 the Delta Latitude, 1/Delta Longitude, 1 is the center of that area.

 c. Lines and irregular multisided areas, i.e. other than squares,

 rectangles, circles, and ellipses, shall not be slaved.

 d. The slaved point or area center is plotted as the difference in

 Latitude and Longitude from the position of Related TN at the time of the

 report, regardless of whether slaved true or relative, and regardless of the

 course of Related TN. If slaved true, the constant true bearing is then


-----

###### determined as the azimuth between True North and the position of the slaved

 point or area center, measured clockwise from the position of Related TN. If

 slaved relative, the constant relative bearing is determined as the angle

 between the course of Related TN and the position of the slaved point or area

 center, measured clockwise from the position of Related TN. For relative

 slaving, the azimuth (true bearing) of the point or area center from the

 Related TN changes by an amount identical to any reported change of course of

 the Related TN subsequent to receipt of the slaved point or area message. 

 For slaved ellipses, squares, and rectangles, the Axis Orientation shall also

 change by an amount identical to the course change of Related TN (-180

 degrees if the Axis Orientation exceeds 179 degrees).

 e. The absence or presence of the J3.0C4 continuation word indicates

 whether a point or area center reported in a J3.0 message with Slaved

 Indicator = 1 is slaved by true or relative bearing to the Related TN. For

 both true and relative slaving, the range between the slaved point or area

 center and Related TN remains constant. If the J3.0C4 word is not included,

 the bearing established by Delta Latitude, 1/Delta Longitude, 1 is a constant

 true bearing from the J3.0C2 Related TN. If the J3.0C4 word is included, the

 bearing is relative to the course of the J3.0C4 Related 1 TN. When the

 J3.0C4 word is transmitted, either the J3.0C2 Related TN field shall be set

 to No Statement for a slaved area, or the J3.0C2 word shall not be

 transmitted for a slaved point.

 f. ASW Areas of Probability (AOP) reported in a J3.0 message with

 Point Type = 7 and Point Amplification = 12 shall not be slaved. To relate

 or associate an ASW AOP to a track or point, e.g., a subsurface track for

 which contact has been lost, a J7.7 Association message may be transmitted.

 4.4.3.1.4 NONSLAVED MOVING POINTS, LINES, AND AREAS

 The rules for nonslaved moving points, lines, and areas are provided as

 follows:

 a. Moving points, lines, and areas are reported by setting Course and

 Speed in the J3.0C2 word to other than No Statement. Moving points, lines,

 and areas shall be extrapolated by the host to the time of transfer to the

 terminal. Time (Hour and Minute) and Time Function may also be reported as


-----

###### amplifying information, independent of the reported position, Course, and

 Speed. If time is reported as other than No Statement, Time Function shall

 also be other than No Statement. The Axis Orientation field is not affected

 by changes in Course.

 b. A point, line, or area shall not be reported as moving if it has an

 Activation Time in the future, i.e., if Time Function = Activation Time and

 the Time has not yet arrived, Course and Speed shall be set to No Statement. 

 To cause a point, line, or area to commence moving at the Activation Time,

 Course, and Speed may be reported commencing at Activation Time.

 c. Position and Intended Movement (PIM) and Submarine Position and

 Intended Movement (SIM) points (Point Type = 1, Point Amplification = 4 and

 9, respectively) which are not yet active are exceptions to the above rules. 

 Such future PIM and SIM points shall be reported with the position, Course,

 and Speed that will be effective at the Activation Time.

 d. Land (Ground) Points shall not move, i.e., Course and Speed shall

 be set to No Statement in a J3.5 (PTI = 0) message. The J3.5 (PTI = 0) Track

 Quality field shall be set to 0. Course, Speed, and Track Quality shall not

 be processed upon receipt of a J3.5 (PTI = 0) message.

 4.4.3.2 REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR POINTS, LINES, AND AREAS

 The following subparagraphs amplify the general R[2] rules specified in

 paragraph 4.4.2.2. Both the general rules and the amplification of those

 rules for points, lines, and areas, detailed below, shall be followed.

 4.4.3.2.1 REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR REFERENCE POINTS, LINES, AND

 AREAS AND GROUND POINTS

 The originator of a J3.0 or J3.5 (PTI = 0) point, line, or area retains R[2] as

 long as the originator remains active and reports the point, line, or area. 
 However, if a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message is received, the R[2] unit is declared

 inactive, or if no periodic update is received for three consecutive update
 intervals, another JU may, by operator action only, assume R[2] for the point,

 line, or area using the same Reference TN(s). The latest IU to report on a
 reference or land (ground) point, line, or area has R[2] for the point, line, or


-----

###### area. If a JU without R[2] desires that a specific point, line, or area be

 transmitted immediately without awaiting the next periodic update, it should

 transmit a J7.1 (ACT = 1) Data Update Request for the desired TN.

 4.4.3.2.2 REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMERGENCY POINTS

 Any JU may report, through operator action only, on a previously reported

 emergency point when that JU has additional or more current information on

 the point. In addition, if a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message is received on an
 emergency point, the unit with R[2] is declared inactive, or if no periodic

 update is received for three consecutive update intervals, another JU may, by
 operator action only, assume R[2] for the point. A JU assuming R[2] for an

 emergency point shall use the same TN Reference and the same value of TN

 Previously Reported as those reported by the previous reporting unit. The
 latest JU to report a point has R[2] for that point.

 4.4.3.3 DATA UPDATE REQUESTS FOR POINTS, LINES, AND AREAS

 Paragraphs 4.7.2 through 4.7.2.3 provide information on Data Update Requests

 for points, lines, and areas.

 4.4.3.4 TRACK ALERTS FOR POINTS, LINES, AND AREAS

 Paragraphs 4.7.1.4.3, 4.7.1.4.4, and 4.7.1.4.6 provide information on track

 alerts for Reference Points, Emergency Points, and Land (Ground) Points,

 respectively.

 4.4.3.5 REPORTING TRANSPONDER DATA ON POINTS

 IFF/SIF data (Modes I, II, and III Codes) are transmitted in the J3.1 and

 J3.5 (PTI = 0) messages when available. The IFF/SIF data in the J3.1 message

 shall contain the IFF/SIF modes and codes of the previously reported track

 for which the emergency point was initiated.

 4.4.3.6 TERMINATION OF A POINT, LINE, OR AREA

 When a JU ceases reporting a point, line, or area for which it had reporting

 responsibility, it shall transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message. To drop a


-----

###### segmented line or multisided area defined by more than one Reference TN, a

 J7.0 (ACT = 0) message shall be transmitted for each Reference TN.

 A JU shall not transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message on a point when the point

 becomes an Active IU on the interface with the same TN.

 A JU receiving a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message on a point, line, or area shall not

 be required to purge the point, line, or area. However, if the JU does not

 purge a point, line, or area on which it has received a J7.0 (ACT = 0)
 message, it shall assume R[2] for the point, line, or area to ensure that it

 remains active on the interface.

 4.4.3.7 PURGING OF REFERENCE POINTS, LINES, AND AREAS AND LAND

 (GROUND) POINTS

 JUs may purge remote reference points, lines, and areas and land (ground)

 points if they are no longer required. When a remote point, line, or area is

 purged from a system by local options, a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message shall not be

 transmitted.

 4.4.3.8 PURGING OF EMERGENCY POINTS

 Emergency points are periodically updated and are normally terminated via the

 J7.0 (ACT = 0) message when the emergency ceases. If a JU fails to receive

 the J7.0 (ACT = 0) message and further updates are not received, the JU may

 purge those points after a specified time period has elapsed with no updates.

 4.4.3.9 TIME

 Time may be associated with the reported point, line, or area. This "time"

 may represent establishment, acquisition, activation, deactivation, etc. For

 segmented lines and multi-sided areas defined by more than one Reference TN,

 time and Time Function, if applicable, shall be reported for the first

 Reference TN, and shall be considered to apply to the entire line or area. 

 If time and Time Function are transmitted with any of the subsequent line

 segments or area sides, they shall be the same as the time and Time Function

 transmitted in the first line segment or area side. In those cases when more

 than one time is required (i.e., activation, deactivation) for the same


-----

###### reported point, line or area, additional J3.0 messages shall be transmitted

 for that point, line or area with the appropriate Time Function value set.

 4.4.3.10 EXERCISE INDICATOR IN THE REFERENCE POINT MESSAGE

 The Exercise Indicator in the J3.0 message is only used to amplify J3.0

 messages with the Point Type field set to value 6, Area (Hazard), and the

 Point Amplification field set to value 3, Allied Missile Engagement Zone

 (MEZ), or value 4, Hostile MEZ. An exercise MEZ is one which is being

 reported for exercise purposes only, i.e., the IU, track, or point to which

 the MEZ is related may not be able to actually engage targets in that MEZ,

 nor is it necessary to remain clear of the exercise MEZ for actual

 operational purposes. For all other values of the Point Type and Point

 Amplification fields in the J3.0 message the Exercise Indicator field shall

 be set to value 0.

 4.4.3.11 PERIODIC REPORT INDICATOR FOR POINTS

 When a JU transmits a J3.0 or J3.5 (PTI = 0) original message or a

 retransmission due to data change, the Periodic Report Indicator (PER IND)

 shall be set to value 1. Periodic updates following the original or

 retransmitted message shall be transmitted with the Periodic Report Indicator

 set to value 2 thereby providing each JU with the option to process the

 periodic updates of points. Responses to Data Update Requests for multi
 point areas or multi-segmented lines (defined by more than one J3.0 message)

 shall be transmitted with the PER IND set to value 0 and the Response

 Indicator set to value 1. A change of positional information for a point,

 line, or area with independent course and speed does not, in itself,

 constitute a change of data for the purpose of setting the Periodic Report

 Indicator to value 1.

 4.4.4 AIR, SURFACE (MARITIME), AND LAND (GROUND) TRACK SURVEILLANCE

 The rules and conventions applicable to reporting Air, Surface (Maritime),

 and Land (Ground) surveillance information are based upon the requirements

 for exchanging these data among JUs. Since the requirements are similar for

 Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land (Ground) surveillance reporting, these


-----

###### subfunctions are discussed within this subsection. Specific differences,

 when applicable, are included in the appropriate paragraphs.

 The specific messages used to report Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land

 (Ground) surveillance data are the J3.2, J3.3, and J3.5 (PTI = 1) messages,
 respectively. These messages are monitored by nonC[2] JUs, such as fighter

 aircraft, for situational awareness and early warning information.

 Discussed in this subsection are the various requirements associated with

 Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land (Ground) surveillance data exchange. The

 topics covered are:

 a. Track Reporting Criteria.

 b. Track Reporting.

 c. Track Correlation.

 d. Positional Data.

 e. Velocity.

 f. Identity/Identity Confidence/Strength.

 g. Transponder Data.

 h. Track Quality.

 i. Nonreal-time Reports.

 j. Reporting Inactive Sites as Air and Surface (Maritime) Tracks and

 Land (Ground) Track Data.

 k. Reporting Responsibility.

 l. Information Difference Recognition and Resolution.


-----

###### m. Termination of Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land (Ground) Track

 Data.

 4.4.4.1 TRACK REPORTING CRITERIA

 Track reporting criteria are based on the requirements for the exchange of

 surveillance information and data usable in providing threat warning

 information among systems involved in joint operations. The reporting of

 surveillance track information on the interface shall insure that:

 a. The information on the track is as complete, accurate, and timely

 as possible.

 b. Data are correlated and dual designation is minimized.

 c. The proper rules for reporting a track are followed.

 4.4.4.2 TRACK REPORTING

 Track reporting requires a set of rules which are general in nature and which

 may be adapted to a specific interface configuration to provide an optimum

 exchange of data. The rules are:

 a. The source of track data shall be provided (Source TN).

 b. C[2] JUs that have the capability to automatically initiate tracks for

 release to the interface without operator action shall also have the

 capability to deactivate this automatic capability.

 c. A JU reporting a real-time track shall report the position of the

 track extrapolated to the time of transmission.

 d. Nonreal-time data shall be identified as such and time tags shall

 be provided. Nonreal-time track positions shall not be extrapolated.

 Procedures for reporting J3.2, J3.3, and J3.5 (PTI = 1) messages are provided

 in the following paragraphs. Section 5 provides the detailed message

 transmission rules.


-----

###### 4.4.4.3 COMMON TRACKING

 a. Common tracking is defined as sharing of a common track number and
 shifting R[2] between C[2] JUs. Each air, surface (maritime), land (ground), and
 space tracked object normally will be reported by one C[2] JU while other C[2] JUs

 withhold their reports to prevent cluttering the tactical plot. 
 Determination of the C[2] JU responsible for reporting the tracked object shall

 be in accordance with the procedures in the Air, Surface, Land, and Space

 Surveillance sections. In this section and in section 4.7.3, Resolution of

 Air and Surface Track Dual Designations, a track for which positional data
 has been locally derived by a C[2] JU but is currently being reported by another
 C[2] JU is referred to as a "common local track", and a track for which

 positional data has been locally derived and is not currently being reported
 by another C[2] JU is referred to only as a "local track". In order for common
 tracking to function properly, all C[2] JUs shall perform correlation and

 decorrelation of their local track data with respect to the remote data which

 they are receiving. Failure to properly correlate can result in a dual

 designation. The protocols in this section are to be followed in order to

 minimize occurrences and duration of dual designations.

 b. Each C[2] JU which has a capability to originate and report real-time

 air, surface (maritime), land (ground), or space tracks shall have a

 capability to perform common tracking in accordance with the correlation and

 decorrelation procedures and criteria which follow. The rules for

 correlation and decorrelation differ depending on the E/C of the tracks. The

 rules in paragraphs 4.4.4.3.1, 4.4.4.3.2, and 4.7.3 apply to the correlation

 and decorrelation of both air tracks and surface tracks, unless otherwise

 stated. The rules for correlation of land and space tracks are to be

 determined.

 4.4.4.3.1 AIR AND SURFACE TRACK CORRELATION

 The correlation process commences with comparing locally derived sensor data

 (position, velocity, and altitude) with the data received on the interface,
 in order to prevent or eliminate dual designations. All C[2] JUs that originate

 real-time air or surface tracks shall have an automatic correlation

 capability. The following subparagraphs apply to the correlation of any two

 air tracks and any two surface tracks unless otherwise specified.


-----

###### a. Local Correlation. The method used for internal correlation of

 local sensor data is a system design option, irrespective of any of the rules

 herein.

 b. New Local Tracks. New local tracks shall not be reported to the

 interface until an automatic correlation has been attempted and failed on an

 initial correlation test or on the next test following an initial tentative

 correlation (see paragraph 4.4.4.3.1h). If no tentative correlation is found

 on the initial test, the new local track shall be transmitted. If the new

 local track tentatively correlates on the initial test but fails correlation

 on the next test, the new local track shall be transmitted. A new local

 track that correlates with another track on each of the first two correlation

 tests shall be correlated and held as a common local track. Thereafter, the

 decorrelation rules (see paragraph 4.4.4.3.2) apply to the track. 

 Correlation tests shall include active IUs, remote real-time tracks, and

 other local tracks. If an operator action has been taken which selectively

 released a new local track for reporting, it shall be transmitted, regardless

 of the results of correlation testing.

 c. Automatic Correlation.

 (1) C[2] JUs shall make an automatic correlation test either:

 (a) Upon receipt of each remote real-time J3.2 or J3.3

 track or J2.0 (Originator E/C = 0 or 3), J2.2, or J2.3 PPLI report which is

 not confirmed to have an existing correlation to a local track. Such tests

 shall compare the received remote track or IU to local tracks of the same
 E/C, including previously common local tracks for which own unit has R[2].

 ---OR--
 (b) Immediately prior to each transmission of a local

 track. Such tests shall compare the local track to remote tracks and IUs of

 the same E/C.

 (2) As a system option, common local tracks may be included in

 the above tests. If a correlation of a common local track to another remote


-----

###### TN is determined, it shall be reported in a J7.2 message in accordance with

 paragraph 4.7.3.1.

 d. Manual Correlation.  A manual capability shall be provided to

 initiate the correlation of any two tracks irrespective of the correlation

 test criteria in paragraph 4.4.4.3.1f, the correlation restrictions in

 paragraph 4.4.4.3.1g, or the requirements in paragraph 4.4.4.3.1h, except

 that two tracks shall not be manually correlated if they are of a different

 E/C, or one is simulated and the other is live, or both are remote.

 e. Response to Correlation Request. C[2] JUs shall perform correlation

 tests in response to correlation requests from other units in accordance with

 the requirements of paragraph 4.7.3.2.

 f. Correlation Tests. Correlation testing shall consist of the

 position, velocity, and altitude tests specified in this paragraph. These

 tests are summarized in Table 4.4-1 and specified in detail in the remainder

 of this paragraph. Positions of all tracks and IUs tested for correlation

 shall be extrapolated to the same time. The correlation test shall occur no

 more than 6 seconds after the extrapolation time. A local track shall be

 considered to correlate to the closest remote track or IU that meets all of

 the correlation tests, subject to the correlation restrictions in paragraph

 4.4.4.3.1g and the requirement to pass two correlation tests in paragraph

 4.4.4.3.1h.


-----

###### Table 4.4-1. Summary of Correlation Tests
 Positional Test D ≤ [a*SQRT(L[2]+R[2])+b]dm, where:
   D = Distance in dm between two tracks;   a = "window size multiplier" parameter;   L = MIN([MAX(E(TQL),E(d))],E(c));   R = MIN([MAX(E(TQR),E(d))],E(c));
    E(TQL) = positional error associated with local track quality TQL, from  Table 4.4-2;     E(TQR) = positional error associated with remote track quality TQR, from Table 4.4-2, or remote geodetic position quality Qpg from Table 4.4-4;     E(c) = positional error associated with TQ = c, "MIN TQ" parameter, from Table 4.4-2, or Qpg = j, "MIN Qpg" parameter, from Table 4.4-4;     E(d) = positional error associated with TQ = d, "MAX TQ" parameter, from Table 4.4-2, or Qpg = k, "MAX Qpg" parameter, from Table 4.4-4;
   b = "minimum window size" parameter.

 Course Test If both tracks have speed ≥ 10 dmh:
   MIN(|CR-CL|, 360-|CR-CL|) ≤ f, where:
    CL = local course in degrees;     CR = remote course in degrees;     f = "course differential" parameter;
 Otherwise course is not used in the correlation test.

 Speed Test |1-SS/SF| X 100% ≤ MAX(g,[g(k/SF)]), where:
   SS = speed of slower track in dmh;   SF = speed of faster track in dmh;   g = "speed differential" parameter;   k = alternate speed test factor:    = 200 dmh for air tracks;    = 20 dmh for surface tracks.

 Altitude Test For air tracks, if both tracks have an Altitude Source = 1 or 3, or if the local track Altitude Source is 1 or 3 and the remote track is an IU reported in a PPLI message:
   |AR-AL| ≤ h, where:
    AL = local altitude in kft;     AR = remote altitude in kft;     h = "altitude differential" parameter;
 Otherwise altitude is not used in the correlation test.


-----

###### (1) Correlation Test Prohibitions: The following shall not be

 tested for correlation:

 (a) A track with TQ ≤ e (see paragraph 4.4.4.3.1f(2)), or a

 JU with Qpg = 0 (see paragraph 4.4.4.3.1f(8)(b)). This prohibition does not

 apply to new local real-time tracks, but does apply to nonreal-time (TQ=0)

 tracks.

 (b) Tracks of different E/C, and tracks with existing E/C

 conflicts.

 (c) Simulated tracks with live tracks, and live tracks

 with simulated tracks.

 (2) Variable Parameters: Variable parameters are used to

 specify the default, range, and increments of values to be used in

 correlation tests. They are expressed in the form "default (range,

 increment)". The intent is to enable rapid change of the standard

 correlation tests as experience and conditions dictate. It is anticipated

 that the parameters to be used will be specified in the OPTASK LINK. Systems

 shall be capable of using any value within the specified range and increments

 upon system initialization, and shall set the parameter to the default value

 if no other value is specified. The default values are the same for air and

 surface track correlation. However, the actual value to be used for air

 tracks may be specified differently than that used for surface tracks. The

 variable correlation parameters are defined as follows:

 a = 1.0(0.5-3.0, 0.1) "Window size multiplier". Allows increasing or decreasing the standard TQ-based window sizes to be used by all IUs in an interface.
 b = 0.5(0-2.0, .25) dm "Minimum window size". A value applied to all calculated windows to insure that windows are not so small as to prevent valid correlations, e.g., due to minor errors introduced by extrapolation.


-----

###### c = 7(3-7, 1) "Min TQ". The minimum TQ to be used in positional correlation calculations. Lower TQs shall be treated as if they were c. This prevents correlation windows from being unrealistically large. Note: The value used for c can never be less than or equal to the value used for e.
 d = 10(8-15, 1) "Max TQ". The maximum TQ to be used in positional correlation calculations. Higher TQs shall be treated as if they were d. This prevents correlation windows from being unrealistically small.
 e = 4(2-6, 1) "Restricted TQ". Tracks with TQ less than or equal to e are not eligible for correlation, except for new local real-time tracks (see paragraphs 4.4.4.3.1f(1)(a) and 4.4.4.3.1f(4)).
 f = 45(15-90, 15) degrees: "Course Differential". The maximum difference between the reported course of the remote track and the calculated course of the local track allowable for correlation. If the speed of either track is less than 10 dmh, "course differential" shall not be applied in the correlation test.
 g = 40(10-100, 10) percent "Speed Differential". The maximum percentage by which the speed of the faster track may differ from the speed of the slower track for correlation.
 h = 10(5-50, 5) thousand feet "Altitude Differential". The maximum (kft) altitude difference between two air tracks allowable for correlation. (Not applicable to surface track correlation.)
 j = 2(1-5, 1) "Min Qpg". The minimum value of Qpg to be used in positional correlation calculations. Lower values shall be treated as if they were j. This prevents correlation windows used in testing correlation of PPLI positions from being unrealistically large.
 k = 11(1-15, 1) "Max Qpg". The maximum value of Qpg to be used in positional correlation calculations. Higher values shall be treated as if they were k. This prevents correlation windows used in testing correlation of PPLI positions from being unrealistically small.

 (3) Position Test: Two tracks shall be eligible for

 correlation, subject to the other tests, prohibitions, and limitations of

 this paragraph, if they pass the following positional test:


-----

###### D ≤ [a*SQRT(L[2] + R[2]) + b] dm, where

 D is the distance (in dm) between the tracks;

 a = "window size multiplier" parameter;
 b = "minimum window size" parameter;
 L = Positional error associated with the TQ of the local track (restricted by Min TQ and Max TQ); and,
 R = Positional error associated with the TQ of the remote track (restricted by Min TQ and Max TQ).

 L and R are derived from the formula for the area of a circle, A = Πr[2], with L and R equating to r, the radius of the circle. Thus, L (or R) = SQRT(A/Π), where A is the circular area in dm[2] within which it is assessed that there is a 95% probability that the track lies, as defined by Track Quality [DFI 280 DUI 001] for the local (or remote) TQ. Table 4.4-2 specifies the values of L and R for each TQ.
 Table 4.4-2. Positional Errors Represented by TQ
 TQ L, R 15 0.003 dm 14 0.006 dm 13 0.01 dm 12 0.02 dm 11 0.05 dm 10 0.10 dm 9 0.59 dm 8 1.18 dm 7 2.93 dm 6 5.92 dm 5 8.87 dm 4 11.82 dm 3 14.78 dm 2 29.61 dm

 (4) TQ Limitations: Tracks with TQ less than or equal to the

 restricted TQ value e shall not be automatically correlated, since their

 positional accuracy is not sufficient to support valid correlation decisions. 

 Furthermore, the range of TQs used in determining correlation windows may be

|TQ|L, R|
|---|---|
|15|0.003 dm|
|14|0.006 dm|
|13|0.01 dm|
|12|0.02 dm|
|11|0.05 dm|
|10|0.10 dm|
|9|0.59 dm|
|8|1.18 dm|
|7|2.93 dm|
|6|5.92 dm|
|5|8.87 dm|
|4|11.82 dm|
|3|14.78 dm|
|2|29.61 dm|


-----

###### limited, since use of lower TQs could result in excessively large windows,

 and use of higher TQs could result in unrealistically small windows. 

 Therefore, TQs less than c shall be treated the same as TQ c, and TQs greater

 than d shall be treated the same as d, for purposes of calculating D, the

 correlation window.

 (5) Default Correlation Windows: For the default values of Min

 TQ = 7, Max TQ = 10, minimum window size = 0.5 dm, and restricted TQ = 4, the

 values of L and R in Table 4.4-2 result in the correlation windows shown in

 Table 4.4-3.

 Table 4.4-3. Correlation Windows (Value of D in dm) for  Default Parameter Values
 Remote TQ ≥10 9 8 5-7

 TQ
 8 1.68 1.82 2.17 3.66
 5-7 3.43 3.49 3.66 4.64

 (6) Velocity Test: The reported course of the remote track

 shall be within f degrees of the calculated course of the local track. The

 speed of the slower track shall be within g percent of the speed of the

 faster track, or within g*200/SF percent for air tracks or g*20/SF percent for

 surface tracks, whichever is greater. Velocity comparisons shall use the last

 reported course and speed of remote tracks and the course and speed

 calculated for local tracks at the common time to which the tracks are

 extrapolated at the time of comparison.

 (7) Altitude Test: If the Altitude Source of both air tracks is

 either 1 (Sensor) or 3 (Aircraft Automatic Altitude Report), or if the local

 track Altitude Source is 1 or 3 and the remote track is an IU reported in a

 PPLI message, the altitude differential between the two tracks shall not be

 greater than h. If the Altitude Source of either track is 0 (No

 Statement/Estimated) or 2 (Aircraft Report), Altitude shall not be used in

 the correlation test.

-----

###### (a) When the remote report being tested for correlation is

 a J2.2 Air or J2.3 Surface PPLI message, the maximum positional error

 associated with the reported Geodetic Position Quality (Qpg) shall be used for

 the value of R in the position test. Qpg less than j shall be treated as Qpg =

 j, and Qpg greater than k shall be treated as Qpg = k. The values of R for JUs

 are shown in Table 4.4-4, and the resultant correlation windows for the

 default Max Qpg value 11 and the default Min Qpg value 2 are shown in Table

 4.4-5. (The positional errors associated with each Qpg specified in the Data

 Element Dictionary are calculated by the JTIDS/MIDS terminal at the .39 level

 of probability. They have been converted to the .95 level of probability in

 the tables below, for consistency with the requirements for correlation and

 TQ calculation.)

###### received for a JU held as a common local track, R[2] for the common local track

 may be assumed in accordance with paragraph 4.4.2.2.2d.

 (c) When the remote report being tested for correlation is

 a J2.0 Indirect PPLI message with the Originator E/C field set to value 0

 (Surface) or 3 (Air), it shall be processed for correlation like a J3.2 air

 or J3.3 surface (maritime) track with TQ = 7.

 g. Correlation Restrictions. C[2] JUs shall not automatically correlate

 two tracks if local/remote data held indicates any of the following

 conditions exist. The restrictions do not apply to manual correlation. No

 other correlation restrictions shall be applied for two tracks which pass the

 correlation tests specified in paragraph 4.4.4.3.1f.

 (1) The two tracks have an Identity (ID) difference which

 constitutes a conflict (see paragraph 4.4.4.3.1i). Systems shall have an

 initialization parameter and an operator selectable capability to inhibit

 this automatic restriction. (Use of this capability will be subject to
 interface coordination and must be promulgated to all C[2] IUs. If the use of
 this capability changes, all participating C[2] IUs will be informed through

 voice communication or other communications media. In lieu of specific

 interface direction, all IUs will restrict automatic correlation by default.)

 (2) The two tracks have different Mode II codes, and the local

 Mode II code is current. Systems shall have an initialization parameter and

 an operator selectable capability to inhibit this automatic restriction. (Use

 of this capability will be subject to interface coordination and must be
 promulgated to all C[2] IUs. If the use of this capability changes, all
 participating C[2] IUs will be informed through voice communication or other

 communications media. In lieu of specific interface direction, all IUs will

 restrict automatic correlation by default.)

 (3) Both tracks are locally derived real-time tracks, i.e.,

 being updated with local positional data.

 (4) Either track has the Strength field set to a value greater

 than 1. Systems shall not inhibit correlation if either track has Strength

 set to No Statement.


-----

###### (5) One track is a common local track and the other is a remote,
 and the same unit has R[2] for both tracks.

 (6) Either track is currently the subject of a dual designation

 resolution action involving another TN.

 (7) Each track is subject to one or more (not necessarily the

 same) of the below operational contingency constraints (OCC).

 (a) The TN is the subject of a current engagement status

 message; i.e., the TN is the same TN appearing in a J10.2 Engagement Status

 message Target TN or Reference TN field.

 (b) The TN is the subject of a pending J9.0 Command

 message originated by or addressed to own unit or a J12.0 Mission Assignment

 message originated by own unit for which a reply is required and has not been

 transmitted or received.

 (c) The TN is currently a controlled track, i.e., a J10.5

 Controlling Unit Report message has been transmitted or received.

 (d) The TN is an active or inactive IU.

 (8) JUs may apply one exception to the restriction in paragraphs

 4.4.4.3.1g(1) and 4.4.4.3.1g(7)(a) above. If either subject track is the

 Target TN in a J10.2 Engagement Status message originated by the unit

 attempting correlation, and that track has an ID of Unknown or Hostile, and

 the other subject track has an ID of Friend, then automatic correlation may

 be allowed. The Unknown/Hostile track shall be the dropped Track Number (TN
 2). This exception allows breaking the engagement and/or destroying

 missile(s) in flight. This exception shall not be applied by any JU upon

 receipt of a J7.2 Correlation message. Thus, any JU receiving a J7.2

 Correlation message and also holding OCCs on both tracks or conflicting IDs

 on the two tracks (if the ID conflict correlation restriction is enabled (see

 paragraph 4.4.4.3.1g(1)) shall reject the correlation in accordance with

 paragraph 4.7.3.2a(1).


-----

###### h. Number of Correlation Tests. Two tracks shall pass the correlation

 tests and restrictions in paragraphs 4.4.4.3.1f and 4.4.4.3.1g 2(1-2,1) times

 before the correlation is executed. When two tracks pass the correlation

 tests and restrictions once, they shall be deemed a tentative correlation. 

 The same two tracks shall be tested again upon the next correlation stimulus

 (see paragraph 4.4.4.3.1c). If the two tracks successfully pass the second

 correlation test and there is no correlation restriction, they shall be

 processed for dual designation resolution in accordance with paragraphs

 4.4.4.3.1j and k.

 i. Correlation of Tracks With Conflicting IDs.

 (1) Two tracks shall be considered to have conflicting IDs for

 correlation processing if:

 (a) The ID difference is indicated by the code "1" in

 Table 4.7-2.

 (b) The ID difference is indicated by the code "1*" in

 Table 4.7-2 and the system processes these differences as conflicts, except

 that Hostile vs. Pending shall not be considered a conflict for correlation

 processing.

 (c) One track has the Exercise Indicator set to value 0

 and the other has it set to value 1.

 (2) If conflicting IDs is the only correlation restriction, the

 operator shall be alerted. The purpose of this alert is to cue the operator

 to take one of the following actions:

 (a) Change the local ID or the Exercise Indicator and ID,

 thereby allowing automatic correlation, or

 (b) Transmit an ID Difference Report, thereby allowing

 automatic correlation if the remote ID or Exercise Indicator and ID is

 changed, or


-----

###### correlation, or


###### (c) Confirm the restriction, thereby inhibiting the

 (d) Conduct voice coordination to resolve the situation.


###### (3) If the above actions result in resolution of the ID

 conflict, the TN to be retained shall be tested for decorrelation in

 accordance with paragraph 4.4.4.3.2a before executing the correlation, except

 the test shall be conducted only once.

 j. Dropped Track Number Selection. C[2] JUs shall not automatically

 select as the TN to be dropped a TN which has any of the OCCs listed in

 paragraph 4.4.4.3.1g(6 7). In the absence of such a selection constraint,

 JUs shall select the higher TN as the TN to be dropped. For a track that has

 both a TN greater than 07777 and a TN less than 07777, as reported in a J7.4

 message, the track with TN greater than 07777 shall be used in this

 comparison.

 k. Execution of the Correlation. The following rules apply to the

 disposition of the Dropped TN and the retention of data from the Dropped TN

 upon origination or receipt of a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message for the Dropped TN. 

 The correlation shall be deemed to have failed if no J7.0 (ACT = 0) is

 received for the dropped TN after a period of 60 seconds from the

 transmission of the correlation request and all associated processing for the

 correlation shall be cancelled.

 (1) Disposition of the Dropped Track Number:

 (a) If own unit holds the Dropped TN as a local or common

 local track, the Retained TN shall be designated as a common local track.

 (b) If own unit has R[2] for the Dropped TN, a J7.0 (ACT = 0)

 Drop Track message shall be transmitted for the Dropped TN. If the Dropped

 TN is reported by another IU after transmission of the J7.0, own unit shall

 retain the Dropped TN as a remote track and shall not reattempt to correlate

 the Retained TN and the Dropped TN for a period of 60 seconds after

 transmission of the J7.0.


-----

###### (c) When a J7.2 message is initiated by own unit and a

 Drop Track message has not yet been received for the Dropped TN, it shall be

 retained as a remote track.

 (2) Dropped TN Data Retention: Data specified below shall be

 transferred from the Dropped TN to the Retained TN when the correlation is

 executed. No other Dropped TN data shall be transferred to the Retained TN. 

 It is expected that normal reporting protocols will result in the

 establishment of the appropriate data for the Retained TN.

 (a) Kinematic Data. If the Dropped TN is a local or

 common local track, the Dropped TN Latitude, Longitude, Course, Speed,

 Altitude, Altitude Source, TQ, and Strength shall be transferred to the

 Retained TN.

 (b) Identification Data. Retention of identification data

 is dependent upon whether the ID conflict correlation restriction is

 inhibited (see paragraph 4.4.4.3.1g(1)):

 1 Restriction Not Inhibited: If the Identity (ID)

 (or Identity Amplifying Descriptor (IAD) of two exercise tracks) of retained

 TN and Dropped TN are different and the difference would result in automatic

 acceptance of the Dropped TN ID/IAD in accordance with Table 4.7-2, the

 Dropped TN ID/IAD and Special Interest Indicator, Platform, Platform

 Activity, and Specific Type shall be transferred to Retained TN.

 2 Restriction Inhibited: When the Identity of

 Retained TN and Dropped TN are the same, associated identification data

 (Platform, Platform Activity, Specific Type, Exercise Indicator, and Special

 Interest Indicator) reported for the Retained TN shall be retained. When the

 Identity of Retained TN and Dropped TN are different, the last Identity

 reported for Dropped TN shall be considered equivalent to a J7.0 (ACT = 1)

 Identity Difference Report for the Retained TN. It shall be processed in

 accordance with paragraph 4.7.1.2.2 immediately after the correlation is

 executed.

 (c) IFF/SIF Data. Any Dropped TN nonzero Mode I, II, or

 III IFF/SIF data for a mode for which the Retained TN data is zero shall be


-----

###### transferred to the Retained TN. If the Dropped TN Mode IV data is a higher

 value than the Retained TN Mode IV data, it shall be transferred to the

 Retained TN.

 (d) Force Tell and Emergency Indicators. If the Dropped TN

 had the Force Tell Indicator set to value 1, the Retained TN shall have the

 Force Tell Indicator set to value 1. If the Dropped TN had the Emergency

 Indicator set to value 1, the Retained TN shall have the Emergency Indicator

 set to value 1.

 4.4.4.3.2 AIR AND SURFACE TRACK DECORRELATION

 The following subparagraphs apply to the decorrelation of any two air

 tracks or any two surface tracks.

 a. Decorrelation Requirements. All C[2] JUs that initiate real-time air
 or surface tracks shall have an automatic decorrelation capability. C[2] JUs

 may also perform manual decorrelation, and may have a capability to require

 manual confirmation of automatic decorrelations. Implementation of automatic

 and manual functions shall adhere to the following requirements:

 (1) Automatic decorrelation tests shall be performed for each

 common local track upon receipt of each J2 or J3 message on the track.

 (2) Common local tracks shall be decorrelated if, on receipt of

 2(1-5, 1) consecutive remote track reports, the remote track falls outside a

 distance of 1.5(1.0-2.0, 0.1) times the maximum correlation distance

 calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.4.4.3.1f(3).

 b. Execution of the Decorrelation. After it has been determined that

 a common local track (TN A) satisfies the criteria of an automatic or manual

 decorrelation, the decorrelation shall be executed as follows:

 (1) The local track shall be automatically tested once for

 correlation against remote tracks (not common local tracks) in accordance

 with paragraphs 4.4.4.3.1f and g. If the automatic correlation test fails,

 assign a new TN (TN B) to the local track and report TN B in a J3.2 or J3.3


-----

###### message, with an initial ID of Pending. For manual decorrelation the Pending

 ID may be overridden by operator action.

 (2) Establish TN A as a remote track.

 c. Decorrelation Considerations. If local or remote data held

 indicates one of the following conditions exist, action shall be taken as

 indicated:

 (1) TN A is the Target TN of a J10.2 Engagement Status message

 for a current engagement reported and conducted by own unit, or is the

 Reference TN or Target TN of a J10.2 message for a current engagement

 reported by own unit and conducted by another unit. Decorrelate and alert an

 operator as a cue to transmit the J10.2 message with the Weapon Engagement

 Status field set to value 8 (Engagement Broken) if appropriate. Another

 J10.2 message with the new TN shall be transmitted only if initiated by

 operator action, by a WILCO response to a J12.0 Mission Assignment against TN

 B, or by receipt of a J12.6 Target Sorting message reporting an engagement

 against TN B.

 (2) TN A is the subject of a pending J9.0 Command message 

 which own unit originated or to which own unit is preparing a reply. Execute

 the decorrelation and provide operator display of new track status on TNs A

 and B before release of the J9.0 reply. The reply shall be relative to TN A

 only.

 (3) TN A is controlled by own unit; i.e., is the subject of own

 unit reported J10.5 Controlling Unit Report message. Do not automatically

 decorrelate. If manually decorrelated, alert the operator as a cue to report

 termination of control TN A if appropriate. Report commencement of control

 of TN B using the J10.5 message only if initiated by operator action. If the
 controlled track is a nonC[2] JU, then decorrelate and continue reporting

 control of TN A.

 (4) TN A has been paired by own unit; i.e., is the subject of

 own unit originated J10.6 message. Decorrelate and alert an operator as a

 cue to terminate the pairing on TN A and initiate the pairing on TN B if

 appropriate.


-----

###### (5) TN A has been correlated with an Index Number by own unit,

 i.e., is the subject of own unit originated J12.5 message. Assess whether

 the Index Number should remain with TN A or B, and transmit J12.5 messages as

 appropriate.

 (6) TN A is the subject of a handover which is in progress;

 i.e., a TN in a J10.3 Handover message. The decorrelation shall be delayed

 until the handover process is completed or terminated, then the decorrelation

 shall be executed and an operator alerted as a cue to report control in the

 J10.5 Controlling Unit Report message as appropriate. Operator display of

 the pending decorrelation shall be provided.

 4.4.4.4 POSITIONAL DATA

 The geodetic latitude and longitude for each Air, Surface (Maritime), and

 Land (Ground) track shall be reported in the respective Air, Surface

 (Maritime), and Land (Ground) Point/Track messages. In addition, Air

 surveillance reporting shall include Altitude and Altitude Source when

 available.

 4.4.4.5 VARIANCE AND TIME STAMP ON NEEDLINE PGs

 The J12.6C7 Kinematic Data 1 continuation word is used by nonC[2] JUs on

 Needline PGs to report kinematics estimated errors on the track when it is

 necessary to have more accurate data than the target position quality

 indicator.

 4.4.4.5.1 VARIANCE EVALUATION ON NEEDLINE PGs

 The estimation of error is needed independently on each measurement axis. 

 For instance for a BEARING, ELEVATION, and DISTANCE independent measurement

 and estimation, the variance of error in bearing, elevation and distance is

 required. This is described with a diagonal covariance matrix of estimation

 error (three elements). Seeing that the transmitted track or target position

 is in geodetic reference axes it is logical to transmit the location error in

 the same coordinates. In that case the errors are no longer independent and

 the transmission of the cross terms of error is necessary too. This is

 described with a symmetric 3D matrix with 6 relevant data elements.


-----

###### In what follows X = LATITUDE, Y = LONGITUDE, Z = ALTITUDE.

 If Xe (or Ye, Ze) designates the estimated location, X (or Y, Z) the actual

 location and E the mathematical mean then:

 Var XX = E (Xe - X)[2]
 Var YY = E (Ye - Y)[2]
 Var ZZ = E (Ze - Z)[2]

 Var XY = E (Xe - X) (Ye - Y)

 Var XZ = E (Xe - X) (Ze - Z)

 Var YZ = E (Ye - Y) (Ze - Z)

 Those data are the results of common filters (Kalman, mean square 

 filter, ...).

 4.4.4.5.2 VARIANCE MATRIX

 The variance matrix shall be used when accurate data on the track quality (or

 target position quality) is available in the transmitting center. The matrix

 elements which can not or are not computed by the transmitting center shall

 be set to NO STATEMENT. Each diagonal element can be set to a significant

 value or to NO STATEMENT independently of one another. It is useful to set

 the cross elements only if the diagonal elements are set (for instance Var XY

 shall be set only if Var XX and Var YY are set to a significant value).

 Elements of the covariance matrix of error in estimated track or target

 location defined as follows:


###### Var XX  Var YX  Var XZ Var YX  Var YY  Var YZ Var ZX  Var ZY  Var ZZ


###### 4.4.4.5.3 TIME STAMP ON NEEDLINE PGs

 The SECOND, HUNDREDTHS fields shall be used to specify the best estimated

 date of kinematics elements (LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, ALTITUDE, VELOCITY)

 transmitted in the J12.6I and J12.6E0 basic Words. In case the accuracy


-----

###### cannot be better than 500 ms, a NO STATEMENT shall be set in the HUNDREDTHS

 field. In case the accuracy cannot be better than a minute, a NO STATEMENT

 shall be set in the SECOND field.

 4.4.4.6 VELOCITY

 The velocity of Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land (Ground) tracks shall be

 reported as course and speed. The speed shall be reported in data miles per

 hour of ground speed. The course shall be reported in degrees with respect

 to true north.

 4.4.4.7 IDENTITY DATA

 Track identity as defined in paragraph 4.4.2.1 is exchanged. The platform

 and platform activity fields are defined in the message section of this

 volume.

 For each of the Platform, Platform Activity, Specific Type, and Special
 Interest Indicator fields which are implemented by a C[2] JU, the JU shall

 accept all defined field values for retransmission and operator appreciation,
 in the event of assuming R[2] for a previously-reported track. This requirement
 is independent of the actual values implemented by the C[2] JU for transmission

 origination.

 Values accepted for retransmission shall be retransmitted if the JU assumes
 R[2], unless the JU holds locally derived data other than No Statement (non-NS)

 for the field which differs from the value accepted for retransmission. In

 the latter case, the JU shall report the locally derived data. As an

 exception, non-NS data for the Platform, Platform Activity, and Specific Type

 fields received from the controlling unit for the track shall be

 retransmitted regardless of locally derived data. If the Special Interest

 Indicator is set to value 1, it shall be retransmitted as value 1 by any JU
 assuming R[2].


-----

###### 4.4.4.8 STRENGTH

 The strength of the reported Air, Surface (Maritime), or Land (Ground) track

 shall be exchanged to indicate the number of aircraft, ships, ground units,

 or objects comprising the reported track.

 For Land (Ground) tracks, when the J3.5C3 word is implemented, the J3.5I word

 Strength field shall be computed from the Strength, Total Number of Vehicles

 field. The J3.5C3 Strength, Total Number of Vehicles; Strength, Percent of

 Tracked Vehicles (Vehicle Strength fields); and the J3.5I word Strength field

 are all transmitted. For reception, the J3.5C3 Vehicle Strength fields and

 the J3.5I word Strength field are received as sent. If the J3.5C3 word is

 not implemented, then only the J3.5I word Strength field is transmitted or

 received.

 When the Strength field is computed from the Strength, Total Number of

 Vehicles field, the following translation shall be used:

 Strength, Total Number of Vehicles Strength
 NS NS
 1 Vehicle 1 Unit
 2 Vehicle 2 Units
 3 Vehicle 3 Units
 4 - 5 Vehicles 5 Units
 6 - 7 Vehicles 7 Units
 8 - 10 Vehicles 10 Units
 11 - 15 Vehicles through Greater Than Greater Than 12 Units 200 Vehicles

 4.4.4.9 IFF/SIF DATA EXCHANGE

 The exchange of IFF/SIF modes and codes consists of five functional areas:

 a. IFF/SIF Surveillance Data Reporting (this paragraph).

 b. Unique Mode II Code Protection (paragraph 4.7.6.1).


-----

###### c. Clearing IFF/SIF Data (paragraph 4.7.6.2).

 d. IFF/SIF Difference Resolution (paragraph 4.7.6.3).

 e. IFF/SIF Update Request (paragraph 4.7.6.4).

 Each of the functional areas are described in the paragraphs indicated above. 

 The J2.XC1, J3.XC1, and J7.5 messages are used for this purpose as summarized

 in Table 4.4-6.

-----

###### 4.4.4.9.1 IFF/SIF SURVEILLANCE DATA REPORTING

 The reporting of IFF/SIF surveillance data in the J3.2C1 and J3.3C1 words for
 Air and Surface tracks, respectively, is the responsibility of the JU with R[2]
 while all other JUs without R[2] are responsible for monitoring such data and

 only reporting if they hold different data with the J7.5 message. In this
 way the JU with R[2] can be assumed to be reporting the most current data

 available in the interface. Surveillance reporting rules are as follows:

 a. R[2] units shall report all IFF/SIF valid data locally held for that

 track in accordance with the transmit rules for the J3 messages. Validity of

 codes for established tracks will be determined as either "Valid Data" or "No

 Data" using the following criteria:

 (1) No Data: No valid code is currently held for the subject

 local or remote track/mode. (This condition is reported as zeroes in the

 applicable Mode Code field of the J3 continuation word.)

 (2) Valid Data: Valid code responses are those codes which have

 been received from own sensors on two or more successive interrogations for

 Modes I, II, and III with the same value, one interrogation for Mode IV,

 manually entered codes, or codes accepted in accordance with the IFF/SIF

 Difference Resolution Matrix, Table 4.7-5. This condition will be reported

 by entering the nonzero code in the applicable Mode Code field of the J3

 continuation word.

 b. Any change in the IFF/SIF code values from a No Data status to

 Valid Data or changes from Valid Data to other Valid Data will be reported as

 occurring. Changes from a Valid Data value to a No Data status as a result

 of the clearing function (J7.5 (ACT = 0)) will not cause the transmission of

 a change report. Changes derived from both local and remote sources shall be

 considered for reporting in accordance with this rule.

 c. Tracks with Valid Data which subsequently fail to respond to

 interrogations shall not be changed to the No Data status unless a Clear

 action is taken.


-----

###### 4.4.4.10 TRACK QUALITY

 a. Track Quality is a measure of the reliability of the positional

 information of a reported Air, Surface (Maritime), or Land (Ground) track

 determined by the unit transmitting the track. It is a numerical value of 0

 through 15 which is included in the J3.2, J3.3, and J3.5 (PTI = 1) messages. 

 A value of 0 indicates a nonreal-time report and the values 1 through 15

 indicate different degrees of reliability of the positional data, with 15

 being the most reliable.

 b. The reliability of the positional information is expressed in terms

 of the positional accuracy associated with each TQ value. The positional
 accuracy associated with each TQ value is defined as the area (dm[2]) within

 which there is a 0.95 probability that the track is actually located at the

 time of the report.

 c. TQ algorithms shall be designed to ensure that reported TQ

 accurately reflects the reporting unit's best estimate of positional

 accuracy, at the 0.95 level of probability, in conformance with the

 positional accuracy values associated with each TQ. TQ computations shall

 take the following factors into account, as a minimum:

 (1) Design accuracy of the sensor which is tracking the reported

 track.

 (2) Elapsed time since the last sensor update on the reported

 track.

 (3) Most recently calculated velocity of the track.

 (4) Own unit's current geodetic position quality as supplied by

 the JTIDS/MIDS terminal.

 d. A JU shall not report a TQ value which has an associated positional

 accuracy better than the design accuracy of the JU'S tracking sensor and

 processing gain.


-----

###### e. A JU shall not report a TQ value which has an associated positional

 accuracy which is better than that associated with own unit's current

 geodetic position quality.

 f. A JU shall not artificially increase TQ between sensor inputs.

 g. When reported on the Surveillance NPG by a C² JU, a TQ value as

 specified in Table 4.4-7 shall be initially assigned to a track not locally

 acquired but obtained via a J12.6 Target Sorting message from a nonC² JU. 
 The C[2] JU shall extrapolate the received target's position to the time of

 transmission. If the C² JU has correlated local sensor data for the track,

 this paragraph need not be applied with regard to TQ.

 4.4.4.11 VARIANCES AND COVARIANCES

 Following transformations are elaborated for track or target data issuing

 from needline PGs.

 4.4.4.11.1 TRANSFORMATION OF VARIANCES AND COVARIANCES TO TPQ

 a. If S is the area within which there is a 95% probability that a

 target is actually located at time of report, we get the following

 relationship between S and variances/covariances:

 S = -2.π.ln(0.05) k (var XX + var YY )/(1+k[2]) S ≅ 18.8227 k (var XX + var YY )/(1+k[2])
 with k[2] = (var XX + var YY + √Δ)/(var XX + var YY - √Δ) and Δ = (var XX - var YY)[2] + 4 cov[2] (X, Y)

 altitude:

 - var ZZ = 685.9 sdm (2294*10[6] m[2]) if information about altitude is unknown,

 - var ZZ = S/18.8227 if information about altitude is provided by a sensor.

 4.4.4.12 VARIABLE TRACK QUALITY

 A variable track quality (VTQ) function may be implemented by individual

 units to override normal TQ processing. If this function is implemented, the

 operator shall be able to manually enter a TQ value of 3 through 6 to be used

 as the maximum TQ reported by the unit while VTQ is activated. Once VTQ is

 activated, TQ values shall be calculated normally but any calculated value

 exceeding the entered value shall be reported as the entered value. Using

 the entered value as the maximum TQ value shall continue until VTQ is

 deactivated or a new value is entered. When VTQ is deactivated, normal TQ

 processing shall resume.


-----

###### 4.4.4.13 NONREAL-TIME REPORTS

 A track report is identified as a nonreal-time report with the TQ field set

 to value 0 if any of the following conditions are true:

 a. The track data originate from other than a TDS or JTIDS/MIDS

 equipped aircraft.

 b. The track data have been relayed from another system by other than

 a real-time data link interface.

 c. The track data have been derived from other than integrated

 sensors.

 4.4.4.13.1 TIME

 The time reported shall be the time the positional data reported on the

 interface are valid. This time shall be reported in the hour and minute

 fields of the J3 Amplification continuation word.

 4.4.4.14 REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY

 R[2] procedures for Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land (Ground) tracks are

 contained in this paragraph. These rules are designed to ensure that only

 the JU having the best positional data available is reporting the track on
 the interface. The R[2] rules are as follows:

 a. The first JU to report the track has R[2] on that track.

 b. A JU transmits a track report for an Air, Surface (Maritime) or
 Land (Ground) track only when it has R[2] for that track.

 c. A JU assumes R[2] on a common track if its local TQ at the time of

 transmission exceeds the received TQ by 2 or more.

 d. A JU assumes R[2] if it has local real-time data and nonreal-time data

 were received.


-----

###### e. A JU assumes R[2] if it has not received a remote report on a locally

 held Air or Surface (Maritime) track for approximately 40 seconds, or on a

 locally held Land (Ground) track for approximately 120 seconds.

 f. A JU receiving a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message on a locally held track
 shall assume R[2] at the next opportunity to transmit the track if local

 reporting eligibility remains and a remote report has not been received on
 that track. Immediately prior to assuming R[2] for an air or surface track

 after receipt of a Drop Track message, a JU shall test the track for

 correlation in accordance with paragraphs 4.4.4.3.1f and g, except the test

 shall be conducted only once.

 g. A JU without R[2] for a nonreal-time track with the TQ field set to
 value 0 shall assume R[2] for that track when the track is locally updated by a
 new nonreal-time report. A JU reporting a nonreal-time track has R[2]

 regardless of the time value in the track report. The time value in the
 track report is not a criterion for an R[2] shift.

 h. A JU receiving a J2 PPLI message (with the NPS Indicator set to
 Inactive, Conditional Radio Silence, or TDS Failure) from a JU that has R[2] of
 a locally held track, may assume R[2] at the next opportunity to transmit the

 track if local reporting eligibility remains and a remote report has not been

 received on that track.

 i. A JU relinquishes R[2] for a real-time Air, Surface (Maritime) or Land

 (Ground) track upon reception of a remote track report in which remote TQ is

 greater than the local TQ, or upon reception of a remote track report for the

 track which contains a TQ equal to the local TQ from a JU whose STN is

 greater than the local STN.

 j. A JU with R[2] on a track retains the responsibility until it is

 relinquished in accordance with the above rules or until the track is

 dropped.

 4.4.4.15 INFORMATION DIFFERENCE RECOGNITION AND RESOLUTION

 The exchange of Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land (Ground) surveillance

 information on the interface requires procedures to recognize and resolve


-----

###### detected information differences between local data and data being reported

 on the interface. Detection and resolution of Identity, Special Interest

 Indicator, Exercise Indicator, Platform, Platform Activity, Environment/

 Category, IFF/SIF, and Strength differences are resolved by transmitting the

 appropriate J7 message. The specific procedures applicable to the resolution

 of those differences are discussed in paragraph 4.7, Information Management.

 4.4.4.15.1 SURVEILLANCE DATA DIFFERENCE (POSITION/VELOCITY/ALTITUDE OR

 ELEVATION)

 Differences in position, velocity, or altitude/elevation recognized by a JU

 are not resolved through conflict processing and shall not generate a J7.0

 (ACT = 2) message. However, differences in these elements may cause a JU to

 assume that one TN represents two different tracks or different TNs are being

 used to report the same track. (Refer to Resolution of Duplicate Track

 Number, paragraph 4.1.3.7.)

 4.4.4.16 TERMINATION OF AIR, SURFACE (MARITIME), AND LAND (GROUND)

 TRACK DATA

 The following subparagraphs describe the termination of Air, Surface

 (Maritime), and Land (Ground) tracks.

 4.4.4.16.1 TRANSMISSION OF THE DROP TRACK REPORT MESSAGE

 The J7.0 (ACT = 0) message is transmitted when a JU ceases reporting a track
 for which it currently has R[2], except in the following cases:

 a. When a JU ceases reporting a track because it has relinquished R[2] to

 another JU.

 b. When that track becomes an Active IU on the network with the same

 TN.

 4.4.4.16.2 PURGING OF REMOTE TRACKS

 There may be cases when a system does not receive a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message

 and receives no further updates on the remote track. Each system should have


-----

###### the capability to automatically purge those tracks after a specific time

 interval. The time interval is a system-selected parameter and should

 consider the irregular reporting of nonreal-time tracks. Under this

 condition, a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message shall not be transmitted.

 4.4.4.17 MINIMUM WAIT BEFORE TRANSMITTING TRACKS

 After initially achieving Active status, or after returning to Active status
 from Inactive status or TDS Failure, C[2] JUs capable of assuming R[2] for air,

 surface, or land tracks shall not transmit air, surface, or land tracks until

 sufficient reporting responsibility checks, correlation, and data
 registration are performed (this also applies to a C[2] JU that is deactivating

 a receive filter). The minimum wait before reporting air and surface tracks

 is 12 seconds and for land tracks is 48 seconds. This may be either an

 automatic or manual function. System design should allow for longer wait

 times as well as an override in cases where operational necessity requires a

 shorter wait time or none at all.

 4.4.5 SUBSURFACE (MARITIME) SURVEILLANCE

 The rules and conventions applicable to reporting Subsurface (Maritime)

 surveillance information are based upon the requirements for exchanging these

 data between JUs but differ from those for Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land

 (Ground) reporting due to the nature of the source of the information. The

 specific message used to report Subsurface surveillance tracks is the J3.4

 Subsurface (Maritime) Track message. The relationship of acoustic and ASW

 point to Subsurface track reports is described in paragraphs 4.8.4 and

 4.8.4.2. Discussed in this subsection are the various requirements

 associated with Subsurface surveillance data exchange.

 4.4.5.1 TRACK REPORTING CRITERIA

 Track reporting criteria are based on the requirements for the exchange of

 Subsurface surveillance information and data useable in providing threat

 warning information between systems involved in joint operations. The

 reporting of Subsurface surveillance track information on the interface shall

 ensure that:


-----

###### a. The information on the track is as complete, accurate, and timely

 as possible.

 b. The proper rules for reporting a track are followed.

 4.4.5.2 SUBSURFACE (MARITIME) SURVEILLANCE REPORTING

 The J3.0, J3.4, and J5.4 messages are used to exchange tactically significant

 information that has been derived from ASW sensors. Within the Subsurface

 surveillance function these messages are used to report bearings, ranges, and

 tracks.

 4.4.5.2.1 SUBSURFACE (MARITIME) TRACK REPORTING

 The rules for Subsurface surveillance track reporting are:

 a. The source of track data shall be provided (Source TN).

 b. Established local tracks shall be reported with all known

 parameters at the next reporting opportunity.

 c. All data shall be time tagged.

 4.4.5.2.2 ACOUSTIC BEARING/RANGE REPORTING

 The J5.4 Acoustic Bearing/Range message shall be used to exchange information

 on bearings (ambiguous and resolved) and/or range derived from ASW sensors. 

 The source frequency is not required to report acoustic information. 

 Bearings shall be reported from the detecting sensor origin.

 a. The J5.4E0 Latitude and Longitude fields shall be set to the

 position of the acoustic bearing origin.

 b. If the detecting sensor is integral to the reporting JU, the J5.4C2

 Origin TN field shall contain the TN of the reporting JU. A towed array is

 considered integral to the ship. If the detecting sensor is integral to

 another unit, track, or point (e.g., non-IU, sonobuoy) being reported, the

 Origin TN field shall contain the TN of the detecting unit, track, or point. 


-----

###### Otherwise, the Origin TN field shall be set to value zero (No Statement) to

 indicate the detecting sensor is neither integral to the reporting JU nor to

 another reported unit, track, or point (e.g., unreported sonobuoy).

 c. The position of a bearing origin need not be the same as the

 position of Origin TN. The origin of a bearing detected by a towed array

 shall be reported as the actual position based on the length of the array.

 When reporting ambiguous passive bearings, Bearing Report Type (BRT) set to

 value 1, JUs shall report bearings using both the Bearing 1, ASW and Bearing

 2, ASW fields of the J5.4E0 and J5.4C1 words, respectively. The origins of

 both bearings must be the same. When reporting a resolved bearing, BRT set

 to value 2, JUs shall report the resolved passive bearing in the Bearing 1,

 ASW field. Upon receipt of a BRT set to value 2, JUs shall not process the

 Bearing 2, ASW field.

 When reporting range to an ASW contact without a bearing, JUs shall set the

 BRT field to value 3, Range Only. When reporting a bearing and range, JUs

 shall set the BRT field to value 0, Bearing and Range, the Bearing 1, ASW

 field to the bearing, and the Range field to the range. The Sensor Indicator

 field may be set to the sensor holding contact, and the Bearing Accuracy, ASW

 and Range Accuracy, ASW fields may be set to the accuracies of the reported

 bearing and range. Upon receipt of a J5.4 message with BRT set to value 0,

 JUs shall not process the Bearing 2, ASW field. JUs shall discard a message

 with BRT set to value 0 or 3 if the Range field is received as No Statement.

 4.4.5.2.3 REPORTING ASW POINTS, LINES, AND AREAS

 The J3.0 Reference Point message with the point type field set to value 7

 (ASW) or value 8 (ASW, 1) is used to report ASW points, lines, or areas as

 specified in paragraph 4.4.3.1. The definitions and use of various ASW point

 types are provided in appropriate operational doctrine, and they may be

 reported on the surveillance net.

 The following ASW point amplification types are reported to provide a

 position or approximate location of a possible target of interest when no

 sensor measurement of course/speed is available for reporting in a J3.4

 message:


-----

###### a. Sinker.

 b. Brief Contact.

 c. Search Center (ASW).

 d. Estimated Position (EP).

 e. Fix (ASW).

 f. Area of Probability.

 Other ASW point amplification types are used in the coordination of ASW

 assets and mission planning and include the following:

 a. NOTACK Area.

 b. Moving Haven.

 c. Sonobuoy Position.

 d. Sonobuoy Pattern Reference Position.

 e. Limiting Line of Approach.

 f. Friendly Weapon Danger Area (FWDA).

 For these ASW points, the time of activation and/or the time of deactivation

 may be reported. NOTACK Area, Moving Haven, and FWDA will be reported with

 both times. If both times are not received, the default period for NOTACK

 Areas is 2 hours and for FWDAs is 155 minutes. For Sonobuoy Position and

 Sonobuoy Pattern Reference Position, time of deactivation will be reported to

 specify the time of expiration of deployed assets, or time of activation will

 be reported to specify the time for the deployment of future assets. 

 Additionally, the sonobuoy RF channel number, depth indicator and transducer

 depth (optional), sonobuoy type, and holding contact status will be reported

 as appropriate for a sonobuoy position. For Sonobuoy Pattern Reference

 position, the pattern type, number of sonobuoys, sonobuoy spacing, sonobuoy


-----

###### row spacing, pattern radius, and/or bearing may be reported as necessary. 

 For Limiting Line of Approach the bearing and time of activation will be

 reported. For ASW Station, the time of activation will be reported.

 Minimum implementation requirements for each ASW point amplification value is

 specified in Appendix A. Word sequence requirements are specified in T/R

 rules and message maps.

 4.4.5.2.4 ESTABLISHMENT OF SUBSURFACE SURVEILLANCE TRACKS AND POINTS

 AND FIXES

 Further refined information concerning a subsurface fix or one of the other

 ASW points reported as specified in paragraph 4.4.5.2.3 above may result in a

 Subsurface surveillance track which would then be reported with a new TN, or

 the reported Subsurface surveillance fix or other ASW point may be associated

 with an existing track.

 4.4.5.2.5 REPORTING SUBSURFACE SURVEILLANCE TRACK DATUM

 C² JUs that report subsurface tracks shall have the capability to report a

 track as a DATUM when contact is lost. The following protocols apply:

 a. The decision to report a DATUM shall be an operator function.

 b. The DATUM shall be reported in a J3.4 message with the same

 Reference TN as the track for which contact has been lost, and the other J3.4

 fields set as follows:

 (1) Data Report Type (DRT) = 4 (DATUM).

 (2) ASW Time Function = 3 (Time Contact Lost) or 1 (Time Datum

 Established).

 (3) Hour and Minute: Time (truncated) that contact was lost or

 DATUM established.

 (4) Latitude, Longitude, 15 Meters Depth, and Depth Contact:

 Last known position.


-----

###### (5) Course and Speed: Last calculated course and speed.

 (6) Sensor: The sensor that held contact.

 (7) All other fields: Same as values held before contact was

 lost unless changed by operator action.

 c. Although the last known course and speed are reported, the DATUM

 shall not move. Last known course and speed are reported only for

 calculation of the DATUM Error and other data related to ASW search.

 d. DATUM Error shall be reported in the J3.4 if calculated. The J3.4

 DATUM Error field is used only when DRT = 4.

 e. DATUMs shall be updated in accordance with the J3.4 Transmit Rules.

 However, all data except DATUM Error shall remain the same as reported in the

 initial DATUM report, unless changed by operator action.

 f. A DATUM shall only be dropped or purged by operator action.

 g. If contact is regained, a J3.4 with DRT set to value 0, 1 or 2

 shall be reported with the same TN as the DATUM, or a new TN depending on

 operator action.

 4.4.5.3 TRACK ASSOCIATION

 Because Subsurface (Maritime) surveillance is performed using different

 information sources than those used for Air, Surface (Maritime), or Land

 (Ground) surveillance (e.g., Radar or IFF/SIF transponder), the correlation

 procedures which are specified for Air, Surface (Maritime), or Land (Ground)

 tracks are not applied to Subsurface tracks. Instead, it is the function of

 the operator to perform manual correlation of Subsurface surveillance data. 

 In order to provide for a complete compilation of the subsurface situation,

 the J7.7 Track Association message is used whenever it is determined that two

 Track Numbers (TNs) are being used to report information for the same target.

 Procedures to recognize and resolve remote and local track information

 differences are covered in paragraph 4.4.5.12.


-----

###### 4.4.5.4 POSITIONAL DATA

 The geodetic latitude and longitude for each Subsurface surveillance track

 shall be reported in the J3.4 message. In addition, Subsurface surveillance

 reporting shall include the capability for specifying depth when available.

 4.4.5.5 VELOCITY

 The velocity of Subsurface surveillance tracks shall be reported as course

 and speed. The speed shall be reported in data miles per hour of ground

 speed. The course shall be reported in degrees with respect to true north.

 4.4.5.6 IDENTITY DATA

 Track identity, as defined in paragraph 4.4.2.1, is exchanged using the

 Identity field. Platform and Platform Activity may also be reported in the

 J3.4I message to further amplify the identity of the reported track in

 accordance with paragraph 4.4.2.1.3.

 4.4.5.7 DISCRETE IDENTIFIER CODE (SPECIAL)

 Discrete Identifier Codes (Special) shall be reported in the J7.5 message in

 accordance with paragraph 4.7.6.5.

 4.4.5.8 TRACK QUALITY

 Track quality is not applicable to Subsurface surveillance (See paragraph

 4.4.5.10.).

 4.4.5.9 TIME

 The time shall be the time contact was first acquired/time datum established,

 the time of current positional data, or the time contact was lost. This time

 shall be reported in the Hour; Minute; and Time Function, ASW fields of the

 J3.4C1 word.


-----

###### 4.4.5.10 SUBSURFACE TRACK REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY

 Subsurface track reporting responsibility procedures are different from those

 for Air, Surface (Maritime), and Land (Ground) tracks. It is often desirable

 that more than one JU report the same Subsurface contact using different TNs. 

 This is to ensure continuity of reporting when contact is frequently

 lost/regained, and to allow comparison of different JUs' data to localize and
 identify contacts. The following are the R[2] rules for Subsurface tracks:

 a. The first JU to report a contact assumes reporting responsibility

 for that Track Number. No other JU shall report the contact using that track

 number, unless one of the following occurs:

 (1) A J7.0 (ACT = 0) Drop Track message is received containing

 the TN.

 (2) A J3.4 message containing the TN is not received for two

 consecutive periodic updates.

 b. Any other JU may report what it believes to be the same contact

 using a different TN. When this is done, only locally derived data shall be

 reported in the J3.4 message, i.e., the J3.4 messages shall not contain data

 derived only by the reception of remote data from other IU(s) reporting the

 same contact.

 4.4.5.11 REPORTING INACTIVE INTERFACE UNITS AS SUBSURFACE SURVEILLANCE

 TRACKS

 When a JU determines that a Subsurface IU is no longer active on the
 interface and the JU also holds local data on the IU, it shall assume R[2] by

 reporting a J3.4 Subsurface (Maritime) Track message using the inactive IU

 address as the reference TN. No other JU shall report the inactive IU using

 other than the inactive IU address as the reference TN. Should the inactive
 IU return to the interface as an Active IU, the JU holding R[2] shall cease

 reporting the IU, but a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message shall not be transmitted. If

 a TN has been previously reported on the IU, using other than the IU's

 address, the J7.2 message may be used to resolve the dual designation to the

 IU's address.


-----

###### 4.4.5.12 INFORMATION DIFFERENCE RECOGNITION AND RESOLUTION

 The exchange of subsurface surveillance information on the interface requires

 procedures to recognize and resolve detected information differences between

 local data and data being reported on the interface. Differences are

 resolved by transmitting the appropriate J7 message. The specific procedures

 applicable to resolution of those differences are discussed in paragraph 4.7,

 Information Management. Differences in position, velocity, or depth

 recognized by a JU are not resolved through automated conflict processing and

 shall not generate a J7.0 (ACT = 1 or 2) message.

 4.4.5.13 TERMINATION OF SUBSURFACE TRACK DATA

 The following subparagraphs describe the termination of Subsurface tracks.

 4.4.5.13.1 TRANSMISSION OF THE DROP TRACK REPORT MESSAGE

 The J7.0 (ACT = 0) message is transmitted when a JU ceases reporting a track

 except when that track becomes an active IU on the network with the same

 address as was previously being used as the reference TN. For NOTACK areas,

 Moving Havens, and FWDAs, a J7.0 (ACT=0) message shall be transmitted at time

 of deactivation.

 4.4.5.13.2 PURGING OF REMOTE TRACKS

 There may be cases when a system does not receive a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message

 and receives no further updates on the remote track. Each system will have

 the capability to automatically purge those tracks (DRT = 0-3) after a

 specific time interval. The time interval is a system-selected parameter and

 should consider the irregular reporting of Subsurface surveillance tracks. 

 Under this condition a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message shall not be transmitted. 

 DATUMS (DRT = 4) shall not be purged automatically.

 4.4.6 SPACE AND BALLISTIC MISSILE SURVEILLANCE

 The rules and conventions applicable to reporting Ballistic Missile

 surveillance information are based upon system requirements for exchanging

 these data between JUs. The J3.6 Space Track message is used to report


-----

###### Ballistic Missile surveillance tracks. The various requirements associated

 with Ballistic Missile surveillance data exchange are discussed with the

 following topics:

 a. Track Reporting Criteria.

 b. Track Reporting.

 c. Launch Point Reporting.

 d. Impact Point Reporting.

 e. Error Reporting.

 f. Track Correlation.

 g. Positional Data.

 h. Velocity.

 i. Covariance Data.

 j. Identity.

 k. Track Quality.

 l. Lost Track Indicator.

 m. Time.

 n. Reporting Responsibility.

 o. Information Difference Recognition and Resolution.

 p. Termination of Ballistic Missile Track Data.


-----

###### 4.4.6.1 BALLISTIC MISSILE TRACK/POINT REPORTING CRITERIA

 Ballistic missile track/point reporting criteria are based on requirements

 for exchanging surveillance information to provide targeting and threat

 warning information among systems involved in joint operations. JUs

 reporting Ballistic Missile surveillance information on the interface shall

 ensure the following:

 a. The information on the ballistic missile track/point is as

 complete, accurate, and timely as possible.

 b. Data are correlated and dual designation is minimized.

 c. The proper rules for reporting a ballistic missile track/point are

 followed.

 4.4.6.2 BALLISTIC MISSILE TRACK/POINT REPORTING

 Ballistic missile track/point reporting requires a set of rules that are

 general in nature and adaptable to a specific interface configuration which

 provides for optimum exchange of data. The rules are as follows:

 a. The source of ballistic missile track/point data shall be provided

 (Source TN).

 b. Established local ballistic missile tracks/points that cannot be

 correlated with a remote track/point received by the detecting JU shall be

 reported with all known parameters, except covariance, at the next reporting

 opportunity.

 c. Ballistic missile data shall be time tagged.

 d. A JU reporting a real-time ballistic missile track shall report the

 position and associated parameters of the track valid at the time tagged.

 e. If reported, friendly interceptor missile tracks shall be reported

 on the interface using the J3.2 Air Track message for missiles capable only

 of endoatmospheric intercepts, and the J3.6 Space Track message for


-----

###### interceptors capable of exoatmospheric intercepts. When reporting an

 interceptor missile in the J3.2 message, Platform and Platform Activity shall

 be reported.

 f. A JU with R[2] of a ballistic missile track shall maintain R[2] on the

 related Impact Point.

 g. Upon transmission or reception of a Drop Track Report for a
 ballistic missile, the JU with R[2] of the Launch Point or Impact Point shall

 transmit the Impact Point and/or Launch Point messages with the

 Connect/Disconnect field set to value 1, Disconnect. Any subsequent reports

 of the Impact Point or Launch Point shall be transmitted with the Related 2

 Track Number field Of the J3.0C5 message set to value 0, No Statement.

 h. A JU shall not transmit an initial surveillance report on a

 ballistic missile if the predicted time to impact is less than 16 seconds. 

 Similarly, if the altitude of the descending ballistic missile is less than 8

 data miles, an initial Ballistic Missile surveillance report shall not be

 transmitted. Impact points are not subject to this constraint.

 4.4.6.3 BALLISTIC MISSILE LAUNCH POINT REPORTING

 a. The J3.0 Reference Point message is used to report the actual or

 expected Launch Point of a ballistic missile. The Launch Point will normally

 be derived via back azimuth from a missile track or by sensor detection of a

 launch. The time of the launch is reported to the nearest second with the

 Time Function field set to value 4, Departure Time. An early warning

 indication of an expected launch shall be reported by setting the Time

 Function field to Departure Time and setting the Hour, Minute, and Second

 fields to either No Statement or to the expected time of launch. If a

 missile launch point is related to a specific ballistic missile track it

 shall be identified in the J3.0C5 Related 2 Track Number field. If the

 actual launcher is detected by sensors, a J3.2, J3.3, J3.4, or J3.5 message

 shall be transmitted. If the actual launcher is associated with a launch

 point, it shall be associated using the J7.7 Association message.

 b. The originator of a J3.0 Ballistic Missile Launch Point retains R[2]

 as long as the originator remains active and reports the point. However, if


-----

###### a J7.0 (ACT = 0) Drop Track Report message is received, the R[2] unit is

 declared inactive, or if no periodic update is received for three consecutive
 update intervals, another IU may, by operator action only, assume R[2] for the

 point using the same Reference TN. The latest IU to report on a ballistic
 missile launch point has R[2] for the point.

 4.4.6.4 BALLISTIC MISSILE IMPACT POINT REPORTING

 The J3.0 Reference Point message is used to report the actual or expected

 Impact Point of a ballistic missile. The type of warhead, if known, shall be

 reported in the J3.0C5 Space Amplification field with a measure of the

 certainty reported in the Amplification Confidence field. The actual or

 expected time of impact is reported to the nearest second with the Time

 Function field set to value 3, Arrival Time. A pre-launch indication of an

 expected Impact Point shall be reported by setting the Time Function field to

 Arrival Time and the Hour, Minute, and Second fields to either No Statement

 or to the expected time of impact. If the Impact point is related to a

 specific ballistic missile track it shall be identified in the J3.0C5 Related

 2 Track Number field. A related TN for Impact Point will be used only by the
 C[2] JU with R[2] for the related missile track. Therefore a change in R[2] of the
 ballistic missile track also causes a change in R[2] for the related Impact

 Point. There is no requirement to continue transmitting a missile impact

 point after predicted impact.

 4.4.6.5 BALLISTIC MISSILE LAUNCH/IMPACT POINT ERROR REPORTING

 The reliability of ballistic missile launch/impact information is expressed

 in terms of location accuracy associated with the J3.0C5 Square/Circle

 Switch, Axis Orientation, Area Major Axis 4, and Area Minor Axis 4 fields. 

 The positional accuracy associated with these fields is defined as the area
 (dm[2]) within which there is a .95 probability that the point is located within

 the area reported in the Reference Point Message. The Probability estimate

 shall include the effects of measurement errors, systematic errors, and known

 maneuvering capabilities used to project launch or impact points.


-----

###### 4.4.6.6 BALLISTIC MISSILE TRACK CORRELATION

 Track correlation prevents/eliminates dual designations. The process of

 correlation consists of comparing locally derived sensor data, e.g.,

 position, velocity, boost indication, etc., with the data received on the

 interface. In order to eliminate dual designations, it is imperative that

 each ballistic missile track reported on the interface represent a single

 data point. Conversely, track decorrelation should occur when it is

 determined more than one data point exists for a ballistic missile track

 currently being reported.

 The situations most likely to lead to dual ballistic missile designations are

 as follows:

 a. Initial report on ballistic missile contacts.

 b. Track merging.

 c. Simultaneous multiple launches.

 d. Existence of registration errors.

 e. Time of observation differences.

 f. High velocity contacts.

 The implementation of specific ballistic missile track correlation techniques

 depends on the system capabilities, i.e., manual versus automatic track

 initiation systems, two-dimensional versus three-dimensional radars, etc. 

 The considerations that must be taken into account in order to

 reduce/eliminate ballistic missile dual designations are as follows:

 a. Position, time, velocity, boost, and lost track data.

 b. Data registration procedures.

 c. Periodic correlations on all ballistic missile tracks.


-----

###### d. Track reporting procedures when entering, departing, and reentering

 the interface.

 Each C[2] JU has the responsibility to determine whether the data points being

 detected by its local sensors are currently reported on the interface and if

 there are any conflicts between locally derived information and information
 reported on the interface. To accomplish this, each C[2] JU must continuously

 correlate locally derived ballistic missile tracks with ballistic missile
 tracks reported on the Surveillance NPG. Each C[2] JU shall report on all
 uncorrelated local ballistic missile tracks and shall assume R[2] for those
 tracks in accordance with the R[2] rules as specified in paragraph 4.4.6.15. In
 the event of conflict, the C[2] JU shall resolve the difference by transmitting

 the appropriate J7 message, by operator procedure, or by voice coordination.

 4.4.6.7 BALLISTIC MISSILE POSITIONAL DATA

 The positional data for ballistic missile tracks are reported in the Space

 Track message as X, Y, Z position in earth-centered, earth-fixed (ECF)

 Cartesian coordinates defined by the World Geodetic System-84 (WGS-84)

 Reference Frame.

 4.4.6.8 BALLISTIC MISSILE VELOCITY

 The velocity of ballistic missile tracks shall be reported as the rate of

 change along the X, Y, Z axis.

 4.4.6.9 BALLISTIC MISSILE COVARIANCE DATA

 The ballistic missile covariance data related to the reported state vector

 (consisting of the three position coordinates followed by the three velocity

 values) shall be reported in accordance with the transmit/receive rules for

 the Space Track Message. When reported, ballistic missile covariance data

 shall include the best estimate of both tracking errors and statistical

 estimates of biases produced by emplacement errors, alignment errors, and

 other systematic errors. Instead of transmitting the covariance matrix

 directly, ballistic missile covariance data shall be transmitted with the

 root variances of the covariance matrix and elements of the Cholesky

 decomposition of the precompensated correlation matrix as defined and


-----

###### discussed in the following paragraphs. Depending on the sequence of

 transmitted words, either the covariance matrix, or the spatial covariance

 submatrix and the velocity covariance submatrix can be constructed from the

 received data as described in paragraphs 4.4.6.9.10 and 4.4.6.9.11.

 The error estimate information of the ballistic missile track, the covariance

 information, is contained in the J3.6 continuation words. The covariance

 information can be passed as either full or partial covariance. Full

 covariance requires the transmitter to perform an encoding process of the

 full covariance matrix P into the J3.6C1, J3.6C2, J3.6C3, and J3.6C4 words. 

 Partial covariance requires the transmitter to perform two separate encoding

 processes: (1) The spatial covariance information is encoded into the J3.6C1

 word; (2) the velocity information is separately encoded into the J3.6C5

 word.

 Details of the encoding and decoding process are contained in the follow-on

 paragraphs. An overview of the encoding/decoding process is as follows (the

 matrix variables used in the overview are consistent with those used in the

 detailed explanation):

 Overview of Transmitter Encoding.

 a. The covariance matrix P is derived from a ballistic missile

 tracking and error estimation process. Matrix P can be either the full

 covariance (6 x 6) terms, or a partial covariance matrix (3 x 3). In the

 case of the partial covariance, this process is applied separately to the

 spatial covariance information (the 3 x 3 upper left submatrix of P) or the

 velocity covariance information (the 3 x 3 lower right submatrix of P). The

 only difference between the full and partial process is in the number of

 terms in the matrices.

 b. The covariance matrix P is converted to the correlation matrix C. 

 This is done by first taking the square root of each diagonal element, that

 is the root variance, and dividing each element in the same row and column by

 that value.

 c. The correlation matrix C is converted to a precompensated

 correlation matrix C'. This is done by multiplying each off-diagonal element


-----

###### by a constant slightly less than one. Precompensation is performed to

 "compensate" for small round-off errors introduced by the transmitting unit

 during message encoding, which might otherwise result in decoding of

 physically implausible covariance values at the receiving unit. C' is

 different from C in that the off-diagonal elements have been multiplied by a

 constant, 1-ε, where ε is a very small number.

 d. The precompensated correlation matrix C' is converted by Cholesky

 decomposition to matrix U. Matrix U is the upper triangular Cholesky factor

 (or "matrix square root") of C'.

 e. Matrix U is then encoded into the J3.6 continuation words. The

 root variances are logarithmically encoded, and the elements of U are

 linearly encoded into the appropriate continuation word fields. For elements

 in the top row of U, only the signs of the number are transmitted.

 Overview of Receiver Decoding.

 The receiver reverses the transmitter encoding process except for

 precompensation. The steps to decoding are as follows:

 a. The receiver reconstructs matrix U from the J3.6 continuation

 words. This is done by reversing the linear encoding to reconstruct all but

 the first row of an approximate Cholesky factor, matrix U. The first row is

 calculated using the known vector length of each column of matrix U, together

 with the transmitted signs, to solve for the elements of the first row. 

 Matrix U is now approximately equal to the transmit matrix U, with some

 round-off induced by the encoding process into the message fields.

 b. An approximate correlation matrix C is then constructed. This is

 done by multiplying matrix U by its transpose. Note that the decoding

 process does not attempt to reverse precompensation. Reversing

 precompensation might make matrix C nonpositive definite, the problem

 precompensation is adjusting for. This correlation matrix C is therefore

 approximately equal to the transmitter's correlation matrix C and the

 transmitter's precompensation correlation matrix C'.


-----

###### c. The covariance matrix P is then constructed from the correlation

 matrix C. This is done by reversing the logarithmic encoding to find the

 root variances, and multiplying each row and column of C by the corresponding

 root variances to get a covariance matrix P. The resulting matrix P is

 approximate to the covariance matrix P sent by the transmitter due to

 truncation and round-off errors from the encoding and decoding process.

 4.4.6.9.1 DEFINITION OF A COVARIANCE MATRIX

 The covariance matrix P is a symmetric 6 x 6 matrix in the form:

##### pxx pxy pxz  pxu pxv pxw pyx pyy pyz  pyu pyv pyw pzx pzy pzz  pzu pzv pzw
######                    P =
##### pux puy puz  puu puv puw pvx pvy pvz  pvu pvv pvw pwx pwy pwz  pwu pwv pww

###### P is symmetric about the diagonal. The upper left 3 x 3 quadrant is the

 "spatial covariance submatrix," where the subscripts x, y, z indicate

 positions in the X, Y, Z directions in the ECF WGS-84 coordinate system. The

 lower right 3 x 3 quadrant is the "velocity covariance submatrix" where the

 subscripts u, v, w indicate the velocities in the X, Y, Z directions in the

 ECF WGS-84 coordinate system.

 The elements of P include tracking errors and statistical estimates of biases

 produced by emplacement errors, alignment errors and other systematic errors. 

 The size, shape and orientation of the error ellipsoid for the target

 reported in the J3.6 Space Track message are defined by a six dimensional

 error ellipsoid.

 Let Ra be the actual target state vector (Rat = [X,Y,Z,VX,VY,VZ]), Re be the

 tracker's estimate of the target state, and X = Re-Ra be the track error. 

 Then P shall be a symmetric, positive definite matrix such that the track

 error is within the following six-dimensional ellipsoid with probability no

 less than 95 percent:

|p p p xx xy xz p p p yx yy yz p p p zx zy zz p p p ux uy uz p p p vx vy vz p p p wx wy wz|p p p xu xv xw p p p yu yv yw p p p zu zv zw p p p uu uv uw p p p vu vv vw p p p wu wv ww|
|---|---|


-----

######               X[T]P[-1]X = 12.5916

 The value 12.5916 corresponds to the 0.95 quantile of the Chi-squared

 statistic with six degrees of freedom. Therefore, for normally distributed

 errors, P is the usual covariance matrix.

 If errors are not normally distributed (e.g., if a contribution to the error

 is uniformly distributed) then P may differ from the covariance matrix (e.g.,

 by linear scaling in the appropriate direction). If the receiver of the

 message requires a high-confidence region for the target state, it should use

 an ellipsoid calculated from P under the assumption of normally distributed

 errors. The intent of the above is that the result will be correct for a

 confidence of 95 percent.

 4.4.6.9.2 DEFINITION OF THE BALLISTIC MISSILE ROOT VARIANCES

 The ballistic missile root variances are defined as the square roots of

 diagonal elements of the ballistic missile covariance matrix defined as

 follows:

 σi = pii

 4.4.6.9.3 DETERMINATION OF THE BALLISTIC MISSILE CORRELATION MATRIX

 FROM THE BALLISTIC MISSILE COVARIANCE MATRIX

 The ballistic missile correlation matrix is a 6 x 6 matrix describing the

 correlation between the errors of position and velocity. The elements of the

 ballistic missile correlation matrix are defined as follows:

                 Cij = Pij/σiσj

 where Pij are the elements of the ballistic missile covariance matrix and σi

 and σj are the ballistic missile root variances.


-----

###### 4.4.6.9.4 DETERMINATION OF THE BALLISTIC MISSILE PRECOMPENSATED

 CORRELATION MATRIX FROM THE BALLISTIC MISSILE CORRELATION MATRIX

 The ballistic missile precompensated correlation matrix C' is defined as

 follows:

               C' = (1.0-2[-22])C+2[-22]I

 where C is the 6 x 6 ballistic missile correlation matrix, I is the 6 x 6

 Identity matrix, and C' is the ballistic missile precompensated correlation

 matrix.

 4.4.6.9.5 DEFINITION OF THE CHOLESKY DECOMPOSITION OF THE

 PRECOMPENSATED CORRELATION MATRIX

 Cholesky decomposition is an algorithm which takes the precompensated

 correlation matrix C' and returns an upper triangular matrix U such that

                  C' = U[T]U

 where U[T] is the transpose of U. The matrix U has the form

 u11 u12 u13 u14 u15 u16
 0 u22 u23 u24 u25 u26
 0 0 u33 u34 u35 u36                    U =  0 0 0 u44 u45 u46
 0 0 0 0 u55 u56
 0 0 0 0 0 u66

 4.4.6.9.6 CONSTRUCTION OF A CORRELATION MATRIX FROM THE INFORMATION

 CONTAINED IN THE J3.6C1, J3.6C2, J3.6C3, AND J3.6C4

 Cholesky decomposition takes a precompensated correlation matrix C' and

 returns a matrix U such that


-----

######                C' = U[T]U

 J3.6C1 through J3.6C4 contain the encoded values of rows 2 through 6 of U,

 and the signs of elements 2 through 6 of the first row of U. This

 information is sufficient to reconstruct U. Once U is determined, the

 correlation matrix can be reconstructed using this equation.

 The elements u1j (j=1,2,...6) of the first row of U are found by using the

 fact that the sum of the squares of the elements in each column of U are

 equal to one:

j

2

###### Cjj =∑u ij =1.

i=1


###### Solving for u1j,

                u11 = 1.0

 u1j = sign (u1j ) s - 1 j j, > 1

 where

j

###### s j = ∑ u ij2.

i=2


###### If the expression under the square root is negative for the jth column, then

 u1j is set to zero and the remaining elements of the column are

 "renormalized":

 u ij [←] u ij/ s j .

###### 4.4.6.9.7 DEFINITION OF THE CHOLESKY DECOMPOSITION OF THE BALLISTIC

 MISSILE PRECOMPENSATED CORRELATION MATRIX

 The Cholesky decomposition is an algorithm that returns an upper triangular

 matrix, U, as follows:

                C' = U[T]U

 where C' is the ballistic missile precompensated correlation matrix defined

 above. The matrix U is in the following form:

 u11 u12 u13 u14 u15 u16
 0 u22 u23 u24 u25 u26

 4.4.6.9.8 DEFINITION OF THE SPATIAL AND VELOCITY COVARIANCE

 SUBMATRICES

 The spatial covariance submatrix is the upper left 3 x 3 quadrant of the

 covariance matrix P below. The velocity covariance submatrix is the lower

 right 3 x 3 quadrant of P. The covariance matrix follows:

###### 4.4.6.9.9 DEFINITION OF THE SPATIAL AND VELOCITY CORRELATION

 SUBMATRICES

 The spatial correlation submatrix Cx is the upper left 3 x 3 quadrant of the

 correlation matrix C below. The velocity correlation submatrix Cv is the

 lower right 3 x 3 quadrant of C. The correlation matrix follows:

##### cxx cxy cxz  cxu cxv cxw cyx cyy cyz  cyu cyv cyw czx czy czz  czu czv czw

###### 4.4.6.9.10 DETERMINATION OF THE PRECOMPENSATED VELOCITY CORRELATION

 SUBMATRIX FROM THE VELOCITY CORRELATION SUBMATRIX

 The precompensated velocity correlation submatrix is defined as follows:

 C'v =(1 - 2-22)Cv + 2-22I

 where Cv is the 3 x 3 velocity correlation submatrix defined above, and I is

 the 3 x 3 identity matrix.

 4.4.6.9.11 DEFINITION OF THE CHOLESKY FACTOR OF THE PRECOMPENSATED

 POSITION AND VELOCITY CORRELATION SUBMATRICES

 The Cholesky factor of the precompensated position correlation submatrix, C'x,

 is the upper left 3 x 3 submatrix of the U matrix which was defined in

 paragraph 4.4.6.9.5.

 To determine the Cholesky factor of the precompensated velocity correlation

 submatrix, C'v, an upper triangular matrix Uv is constructed such that:

|c c c xx xy xz c c c yx yy yz c c c zx zy zz c c c ux uy uz c c c vx vy vz c c c wx wy wz|c c c xu xv xw c c c yu yv yw c c c zu zv zw c c c uu uv uw c c c vu vv vw c c c wu wv ww|

-----

###### C ='v U Tv U v

 where C'v is the precompensated velocity correlation submatrix defined above. 

 Uv is in general different from the lower right 3 x 3 submatrix of U. Uv is

 of the form:

 uv11 uv12 uv13
 0  uv22 uv23                            Uv =  0  0  uv33

 4.4.6.9.12 CONSTRUCTION OF THE SPATIAL AND VELOCITY CORRELATION

 SUBMATRICES FROM THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE J3.6C1 AND J3.6C5

 J3.6C1 contains the encoded values of rows 2 and 3 of the Cholesky factor Ux

 of the precompensated spatial correlation Cx, and the signs of elements 2 and

 3 of the first row of Ux. (Ux is the same as the upper left 3 x 3 submatrix

 of U.) This information is sufficient to reconstruct Ux.

 J3.6C5 contains the encoded values of rows 2 and 3 of the Cholesky factor Uv

 of the precompensated velocity correlation submatrix Cv, and the signs of

 elements 2 and 3 of the first row of Uv. This information is sufficient to

 reconstruct Uv.

 The same procedure is used to reconstruct either submatrix. Cholesky

 decomposition takes a precompensated correlation submatrix C and returns a

 matrix U such that:

 C ≈ UTU,

 where U[T] is the transpose of U. Once U is determined, the correlation

 submatrix can be reconstructed using this equation.

 The elements u1j (j=1,2,3) of the first row of U are found by using the fact

 that the sum of the squares of the elements in each column of U are equal to

 one:


-----

2

###### Cjj =∑u ij =1.

i=1


###### Solving for u1j,

                 u11 = 1.0

 u1j = sign (u1j ) s - 1 j j, > 1

 where

j

###### sj = ∑ uij2 .

i=2


###### If the expression under the square root is negative for the jth column, then

 u1j is set to zero and the remaining elements of the column are

 "renormalized":

 u ij [←] u ij/ s j .

 4.4.6.10 BALLISTIC MISSILE IDENTITY DATA

 Ballistic Missile identity is exchanged as defined in paragraph 4.4.2.1. The

 Space Platform Activity and Space Specific Type fields are defined in the

 message section of this volume. Operational Commander defined values within

 the Space Specific Type field are defined at initialization via the OPTASK

 LINK.

 4.4.6.11 BALLISTIC MISSILE TRACK QUALITY

 Ballistic missile track quality (TQ) is a measure of the reliability of the

 kinematic data reported on a ballistic missile track determined by the unit

 reporting the track. It is a numerical value of 0 through 15 indicating


-----

###### different degrees of reliability of the kinematic data. A value of 0

 indicates a nonreal-time report and the values 1 through 15 indicate degrees

 of reliability with 15 being the most reliable. The algorithm used to derive

 ballistic missile TQ is as follows:

3

###### Β = ∑[σ2pi ( )t + σv2i ( )(t Δt)2 ]

_i=1_


###### where σ[2]pi[(t) represents the positional variance contained in the ballistic ]

 missile covariance matrix, σ[2]vi[(t) represents the velocity variance in the ]

 ballistic missile covariance matrix, and (Δt)[2] is a factor that varies the

 dependence of the computed TQ on the velocity errors of the reported

 ballistic missile track. The variable Δt is an arbitrary scaling factor

 expressed in units of seconds and is specified as an OPTASK LINK variable. 

 The default value of Δt is 6 (0-24,1) seconds. B is the table look-up value.

 4.4.6.12 LOST TRACK INDICATOR

 A ballistic missile track is considered lost when the JU with R[2] does not

 receive any local sensor data since the last transmitted update, or the JU

 determines that the track is lost by other system criteria. Subsequent

 reports on the ballistic missile track will include data held at the time of

 last sensor contact, and the Lost Track Indicator field will be set to value

 1, Lost Track. Ballistic missile track data will not be extrapolated except

 as specified in accordance with paragraph 4.4.6.13.

 4.4.6.13 TIME FOR BALLISTIC MISSILE TRACKS

 Ballistic missile tracks are not extrapolated to time of transmission. All

 ballistic missile tracks will be time tagged to the integer second nearest to

 the measurement time, and all position, velocity, and covariance data shall

 be extrapolated or interpolated to the referenced time. The time accuracy of

 the extrapolation or interpolation shall be at the limit of system

 performance with an intent to achieve an accuracy of 0.3 milliseconds or

 less. Truncation of time without extrapolation or interpolation is not


-----

###### acceptable. Systems must be prepared to accept data that may have time

 fields set to future values.

 4.4.6.14 NONREAL-TIME BALLISTIC MISSILE TRACK REPORT

 A ballistic missile track report is identified as a nonreal-time report with

 TQ field set to value 0, Non-real Time Track.

 4.4.6.15 BALLISTIC MISSILE REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY

 R[2] procedures for ballistic missile tracks are contained in this paragraph. 

 These rules are designed to ensure that only the JU having the best
 positional and velocity data is reporting the track on the interface. The R[2]

 rules are as follows:

 a. The first JU to report the ballistic missile track has R[2] on that

 track.

 b. A JU transmits a track report for a ballistic missile only when it
 has R[2] for that track. A JU with R[2] for a nonreal-time ballistic missile
 track will relinquish R[2] upon receiving a remote real-time track report for

 that track.

 c. A JU assumes R[2] on a ballistic missile track if its local TQ at or

 before the time of the remote track time tag exceeds the received TQ by 1 or

 more.

 d. A JU reporting a ballistic missile track with the Lost Track

 Indicator field set to value 1, Lost Track, is assumed to have a TQ of 5 (1
 15,1) less than that being reported, i.e., if a JU is reporting "Lost Track"
 data with a TQ of 15, a JU holding "Tracking" data may assume R[2] with a TQ of

 11 (regardless of the time tag on the remote track).

 e. A JU assumes R[2] if it has not received a remote report on a locally

 held track for 25 seconds. This rule only applies when the last remote

 report was received with Lost Track Indicator set to value 0, Tracking.


-----

###### f. A JU receiving a J7.0 message with the Track Management Action

 field set to value 0, Drop Track Report, on a locally held track shall assume
 R[2] at the next opportunity to transmit the track if local reporting

 eligibility remains and a remote report has not been received on that track.

 g. A JU without R[2] for a nonreal-time track, i.e., TQ field set to
 value 0, shall assume R[2] for that track when the track is locally updated by a
 new nonreal-time report. A JU reporting a nonreal-time track has R[2]

 regardless of the time value in the track report. The time value in a
 nonreal-time report is not a criterion for an R[2] shift.

 h. A JU relinquishes R[2] for a real-time track upon reception of a

 remote track report with TQ greater than local TQ.

 i. A JU with R[2] on a track retains the responsibility until it is

 relinquished in accordance with the above rules or until the track is

 dropped.

 j. After applying all the above rules, a JU relinquishes R[2] for a real
 time track upon reception of a remote track report with TQ equal to the local

 TQ from a JU whose Source TN is greater than the local Source TN.

 k. A unit assuming R[2] for a ballistic missile track need not assume R[2]
 for the associated launch point. The unit no longer holding R[2] on the

 ballistic missile track may continue to report the launch point in accordance

 with the transmit/receive rules.

 4.4.6.16 BALLISTIC MISSILE INFORMATION DIFFERENCE RECOGNITION AND

 RESOLUTION

 The exchange of Ballistic Missile surveillance information on the interface

 requires procedures to recognize and resolve detected information differences

 between local data and data being reported on the interface. Detection and

 resolution of Identity, Exercise Indicator, Platform, Platform Activity, and

 Environment/Category differences are resolved by transmitting the appropriate

 J7 message. The specific procedures applicable to the resolution of those

 differences are discussed in paragraph 4.7, Information Management.


-----

###### 4.4.6.16.1 BALLISTIC MISSILE SURVEILLANCE DATA DIFFERENCE (POSITION

 AND VELOCITY)

 Differences in ballistic missile position or velocity recognized by a JU are

 not resolved through conflict processing and shall not generate a J7.0

 message with the Track Management Action field set to value 1, Difference

 Report. However, differences in these elements may cause a JU to assume that

 one TN represents two different tracks or different TNs are being used to

 report the same track. (Refer to Resolution of Duplicate Track Number,

 paragraph 4.1.3.7)

 4.4.6.17 TERMINATION OF BALLISTIC MISSILE TRACK DATA

 The following subparagraphs describe the termination of ballistic missile

 tracks.

 4.4.6.17.1 TRANSMISSION OF THE DROP TRACK REPORT MESSAGE FOR BALLISTIC

 MISSILES

 The J7.0 message with the Track Management Action field set to value 0, Drop

 Track Report, is transmitted when a JU ceases reporting a ballistic missile
 track for which it currently has R[2], except when a JU ceases reporting a track
 because it has relinquished R[2] to another JU.

 4.4.6.17.2 PURGING OF REMOTE BALLISTIC MISSILE TRACKS

 There may be cases when a system does not receive a J7.0 message with the

 Track Management Action field set to value 0, Drop Track Report, and receives

 no further updates on the remote ballistic missile track. Each system should

 have the capability to automatically purge those tracks after a specific time

 interval. The time interval is a system-selected parameter.

 4.4.7 ELECTRONIC WARFARE SURVEILLANCE

 Electronic warfare surveillance is the process of developing tactically

 significant information through the monitoring of the electromagnetic

 spectrum. The products of the EW surveillance process are lines of bearing

 (LOBs), fixes, and areas of probability (AOPs). LOBs, fixes, and AOPs are


-----

###### reported via the J3.7 EW Product Information message on the Surveillance

 Network PG. LOBs, fixes, and AOPs may be amplified by the J6.0 Amplification

 message on the Surveillance Network PG. This subsection contains the rules

 and protocols associated with the exchange of EW surveillance information. 

 Topics covered are as follows:

 a. EW Reporting.

 b. EW Reporting Responsibility.

 c. Time Data.

 d. Information Management.

 e. EW Product Information Correlation.

 f. Termination of EW Surveillance Data.

 4.4.7.1 ELECTRONIC WARFARE REPORTING

 EW-capable C[2] JUs and JUs capable of generating and managing track numbers

 shall determine which EW detections are eligible for transmission on the

 Surveillance Network PG. This may be done either manually or through

 automatic association with predetermined reporting criteria. EW detections

 may result in the transmission of LOBs, AOPs, or fixes.

 The word sequences presented to describe EW reporting are the minimum

 required. Additional continuation words may be added to these word sequences

 to amplify EW reports if data are available.

 4.4.7.1.1 LINE OF BEARING (LOB) REPORTING

 The J3.7 EW Product Information Message shall be used to report LOBs derived

 from various sources such as ES, jam strobes, or radio direction finding

 (RDF) equipment. The Fix or Bearing Descriptor (FIX BRG) field in the J3.7I

 word shall be set as follows:


-----

###### a. Value 2 - Bearing, Type Not Specified - An LOB for which the

 reporting JU is unable to specify the bearing as ES, EA, or RDF.

 b. Value 3 - Bearing, ES - An LOB of an intercept obtained from ES

 sources other than RDF.

 c. Value 4 - Bearing, EA - An LOB specifying a jam strobe.

 d. Value 5 - Bearing, Radio Direction Finding - An LOB of an intercept

 obtained from RDF sources with no associated parametric data.

 e. Value 7 - Bearing, Unknown - The direction of arrival of the signal

 is unknown.

 LOB reports include the time of the intercept in the J3.7I word. Elevation

 angles shall only be reported by units who are reporting their PPLI.

 If the 2 sigma bearing accuracy (95% probability) of the passive system is

 available, it should be included in the J3.7C1 word to allow receiving

 systems to generate AOPs. If an LOB results from an evaluated ES intercept

 (FIX BRG field set to value 3), the Emitter Number and the Emitter Confidence

 fields should be set.

 4.4.7.1.2 ELECTRONIC WARFARE FIX REPORTING

 An EW fix results from the crossing of two or more LOBs and is reported using

 a J3.7I/J3.7C1/J3.7C2 word sequence as a minimum with FIX BRG field set to

 value 0 in the J3.7I word. The location of the fix is specified by the

 latitude and longitude fields in the J3.7C2 word. An EW fix may be derived

 either automatically or manually. An EW fix resulting from previously

 reported LOBs shall be assigned a new TN, not one of the TNs assigned to the

 LOBs. The new TN shall be used for all subsequent updates of the fix. 

 However, when an AOP is changed to a fix, the TN of the previously reported

 AOP shall be used for the new fix.


-----

###### 4.4.7.1.3 AREA OF PROBABILITY REPORTING

 A C[2] JU or a JU capable of generating and maintaining track numbers may report

 an AOP based either on organic data, exchange of LOBs, analysis of EW fix

 data, or a combination of the above. An AOP is defined as that area in which

 there is a 95% probability (2 sigma) of a particular emitter being located. 

 An AOP is reported using a J3.7I/J3.7C1/J3.7C2 word sequence as a minimum. 

 The J3.7I word shall be transmitted with FIX BRG field set to value 1. The

 J3.7I word contains the time the AOP was valid and the J3.7C2 word defines

 the AOP. Refer to paragraph 4.4.3.1.2b for the procedures and the fields

 used to describe AOPs with the J3.7 message. An AOP resulting from

 previously reported LOBs shall be assigned a new TN, not one of the TNs

 assigned to the LOBs. An AOP resulting from two or more previously reported

 fixes of differing TNs shall be assigned a new TN, not one of the TNs

 assigned to the fixes. The new TN shall be used for all subsequent updates

 of the AOP. However, when a fix is changed to an AOP, the TN of the

 previously reported fix shall be used for the new AOP.

 4.4.7.1.4 PLATFORM EVALUATION CONFIDENCE

 The Platform Evaluation Confidence field of the J3.7C1 word reports the

 degree of confidence that the emitter's platform is as reported in the

 Environment/Category and/or Platform fields.

 4.4.7.2 ELECTRONIC WARFARE PRODUCT INFORMATION REPORTING

 RESPONSIBILITY

 The unit originating a J3.7 EW Fix, AOP, or LOB report always retains

 reporting responsibility. It is illegal to assume reporting responsibility

 for another unit's J3.7 EW Fix, AOP, or LOB report. Each unit initiating a

 J3.7 EW Fix, AOP, or LOB report shall assign a TN not known to be in use on

 the interface even if it is believed that such a report may concern the same

 emitter currently being reported in another J3.7 EW Fix, AOP, or LOB report

 by another unit. The exception is a unit originating a J3.7 EW Fix, AOP, or

 LOB report on a Fix, AOP, or LOB currently reported by the same unit or

 received from another unit in a J14.0 message shall assign the same TN,

 Reference in the J3.7 message as contained in the J14.0 message. The Source

 TN of these J3.7 messages shall be the Source TN of the unit transmitting the


-----

###### J3.7 message. J3.7 messages transmitted by nonR[2] JUs with the Response

 Indicator set to value 1 shall not affect reporting responsibility.

 4.4.7.3 TIME DATA

 The J3.7I word contains the time the EW product information reported on the

 interface was valid; time is expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds.

 4.4.7.4 ELECTRONIC WARFARE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

 Upon receipt of a J7.1 (ACT = 1) message or upon receipt of a J7.1 (ACT = 0)

 message with an EA, ES, or EW Fixes Data Request Indicator set, addressed JUs

 shall respond as follows (see also paragraph 4.7.2.1.5 and Table 4.7-4):

 a. If the J7.1 Addressee TN is set to value 00177, JUs with R[2] transmit

 all J3.7 EW data on the TN or as specified by the Request Indicator set to

 value 1.

 b. If the J7.1 Addressee TN is set to own JU, transmit all J3.7 EW

 data on the TN or as specified by the Request Indicators, with the J3.7

 Response Indicator set to value 1.

 EW association shall be reported using the J7.7 message. The J7.2 message

 may be used to correlate EW AOPs with surveillance tracks, but shall not be

 used to correlate EW LOBs and fixes with surveillance tracks.

 Paragraph 4.7.1.2, Difference Report, may be used for E/C, Identity, and

 Exercise Indicator data reported in J3.7 messages.

 4.4.7.5 ELECTRONIC WARFARE PRODUCT INFORMATION CORRELATION

 EW AOPs that are reported to the interface may require correlation when they

 are known or suspected to be detections of a surveillance track. If the EW

 AOP can be correlated with a surveillance track, a J7.2 correlation message

 may be transmitted with the Retained TN set to the TN of the track and the

 Dropped TN set to the TN of the EW AOP.


-----

###### 4.4.7.6 TERMINATION OF ELECTRONIC WARFARE SURVEILLANCE DATA

 The transmission of EW product information shall be terminated when the

 information is no longer valid or time-related update requirements are not

 met. The information may be purged in accordance with system design.

 When a JU drops or ceases reporting EW information, that it has been

 reporting on the interface, it shall transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message. The

 J7.0 (ACT = 0) message shall not be transmitted on remote reports. Remote

 reports may be automatically purged based on system criteria.

 4.4.7.7 BEARING ORIGIN

 The origin of an EW LOB may be reported in the following ways:

 a. Own Unit: The Bearing Origin field shall be set to value 0; the

 Origin TN field shall be set to own unit's assigned TN; and the J3.7C2 word

 shall be transmitted containing the latitude and longitude of the bearing

 origin.

 b. Another existing IU, track, or point: The Bearing Origin field

 shall be set to value 0; the Origin TN field shall be set to the TN of the

 designated IU, track, or point; and the J3.7C2 word shall be transmitted

 containing the latitude and longitude of the bearing origin.

 c. A designated position: The Bearing Origin field shall be set to

 value 1; the Origin TN field shall be set to value 0; and the J3.7C2 word

 shall be transmitted containing the latitude and longitude of the designated

 bearing origin.

 4.4.8 NONC[2] JU USE OF SURVEILLANCE NPG

 To support their missions, nonC[2] JUs shall monitor the Surveillance NPG;

 however, they are prohibited from transmitting on this NPG.

 Remote surveillance track and point data available in the J3 series messages
 shall provide nonC[2] JUs situational awareness and early warning information.


-----

###### NonC[2] JUs shall process J7.0 messages with the Track Management Action field

 set to value 0, Drop Track Report, for locally held remote tracks. 
 Additionally, nonC[2] JUs may have the capability to automatically purge locally

 held remote tracks, after a specified time interval, when these tracks are no

 longer being updated. The time interval is a system selected parameter.


-----

###### 4.5 ELECTRONIC WARFARE

 The following describes the relationship of EW to command, control, and

 surveillance. Other portions of the Link 16 interface design that support EW

 are contained in paragraphs 4.4, Surveillance; 4.7, Information Management;

 4.10, Mission Management; and 4.11, Weapons Coordination and Management.

 4.5.1 DEFINITIONS

 Frequently used terms relating to EW are defined below.

 4.5.1.1 ELECTRONIC WARFARE

 Military action involving the use of electromagnetic energy to determine,

 exploit, reduce, or prevent hostile use of the electromagnetic spectrum and

 action that retains friendly use of the electromagnetic spectrum (Joint Pub

 1-02). There are three divisions within EW:

 a. Electronic Warfare Support - Actions taken to search for,

 intercept, identify, and locate sources of radiated electromagnetic energy

 for the purpose of immediate threat recognition. Thus, ES provides a source

 of EW information required to conduct electronic attack (EA), electronic

 protection (EP), avoidance, targeting, and other tactical employment of

 forces (Joint Pub 1-02).

 b. Electronic Attack - Actions taken to prevent or reduce an enemy's

 effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum. EA includes electronic

 jamming and electronic deception (Joint Pub 1-02).

 c. Electronic Protection - Actions taken to ensure friendly effective

 use of the electromagnetic spectrum despite the enemy's use of EW (Joint Pub

 1-02).

 4.5.1.2 ELECTRONIC WARFARE SURVEILLANCE (EWS)

 EWS is the reporting of EW information to supplement the general surveillance

 picture.


-----

###### 4.5.1.3 NONELECTRONIC WARFARE COMMAND AND CONTROL JTIDS/MIDS UNITS
 (NONEW C[2])

 NonEW C[2] JUs are C[2] units which have no organic EW capability other than to:

 a. Request EWS product information.

 b. Use EWS product information in their own surveillance systems.

 c. Coordinate activities of weapon systems with other C[2] JUs.

 d. Control nonC[2] JU weapon platforms.

 NonEW C[2] JUs do not participate in the EW Network PG and the EW control

 function.

 4.5.1.4 COMMAND AND CONTROL ELECTRONIC WARFARE JTIDS/MIDS UNITS

 C[2] EW JUs, in addition to the usual C[2] functions, possess organic EW
 processing capability. A C[2] EW JU has the capacity to collect, coordinate and

 analyze parametric ES data from the EW Network PG and derive EWS product
 information for reporting on the Surveillance Network PG. The C[2] EW JU

 participates in the EW Network PG to control and coordinate EW activities as
 well as the Surveillance Network PG(s). Additionally, a C[2] EW JU may

 participate on the Mission Management/Weapons Coordination Network PG(s).

 4.5.1.5 NONCOMMAND AND CONTROL EW JTIDS/MIDS UNITS

 A nonC[2] EW JU may be either an ES collecting/reporting unit or an EW weapons
 platform. NonC[2] EW JUs coordinate with C[2] EW JUs and/or with one another. 

 They will participate on only the EW Network PG to facilitate the control,

 coordination, and exchange of EW information.

 4.5.2 ELECTRONIC WARFARE COORDINATION PROCEDURES

 EW control directs actions to be taken by EW Net participants involving

 radiated electromagnetic energy. Such actions include, among other things,

 ES, search, direction finding, track evaluation, and jamming. EW


-----

###### coordination includes the sharing of data among the EW net participants to

 provide the most complete evaluation and fixing of intercepted electronic

 emissions. The J14.2 EW Control/Coordination message is used to accomplish

 both objectives.

 4.5.2.1 ELECTRONIC WARFARE CONTROL INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS

 The information exchange requirements are shown in Table 4.5-1 in relation to

 the Link 16 messages that support them.

 4.5.3 ELECTRONIC WARFARE CONTROL/COORDINATION MESSAGE DESCRIPTION

 Messages used to effect EW control and coordination and to report the results

 of EW requests are described in the following paragraphs.

 4.5.3.1 ELECTRONIC WARFARE CONTROL/COORDINATION MESSAGE

 The J14.2 EW Control/Coordination message provides the capability to control

 EW Net participants, to respond to EW Net participants' requests, and to

 coordinate EW activities among EW Net participants. Any EW Net participant

 may use the J14.2 message on the EW network. Coordination will be achieved

 by operational plans or by local procedures using voice or other means. The

 J14.2 EW Control/Coordination message contains the EW Action Value field

 which is used to specify a requested action and to report the results of this

 action. The code in the R/C field of the J14.2I word specifies the required

 responses to the J14.2 message. The Request Number field in the J14.2

 provides an audit trail to ensure continuity between a request and a

 response. When the Request Number data element is set to zero in the J14.0

 message, it identifies the message as an autonomous report. Refer to the

 J14.2 Message Summary Section 5.3 for the listing of the J14.2 message words

 and their respective Data Elements.

 4.5.3.2 PARAMETRIC INFORMATION MESSAGE

 The J14.0 Parametric Information message contains all of the detailed

 parametric information that may be the result of an ES action.


-----

###### The unit originating a J14.0 EW Fix, AOP, or LOB report always retains

 reporting responsibility. It is illegal to assume reporting responsibility

 for another unit's J14.0 EW Fix, AOP, or LOB report. Each unit initiating a

 J14.0 EW Fix, AOP, or LOB report shall assign a TN not currently in use on

 the interface, even if is believed that such a report may concern the same

 emitter currently being reported in another J14.0 EW Fix, AOP, or LOB report

 by another unit. The exception is a unit originating a J14.0 report on an EW

 Fix, AOP, or LOB which is currently being reported in a J3.7 message by the

 same or another unit shall assign the same TN, Reference in the J14.0 message

 as contained in the J3.7 message. The Source TN of these J14.0 messages

 shall be the Source TN of the unit transmitting the J14.0 message. J14.0
 messages transmitted by nonR[2] JUs with Response Indicator set to value 1 shall

 not affect reporting responsibility.

 The J14.0I word contains the time the parametric information reported on the

 interface was valid; time is expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds.

###### 4.5.3.3 ELECTRONIC WARFARE CONTROL/COORDINATION PROCEDURES

 EW Control and Coordination procedures provide for the control of EW Net

 participants and the exchange of EW information between EW Net participants. 

 These procedures facilitate conduct of traditional EW functions among the EW

 capable JUs. Procedures specifically designed for EW Control/Coordination

 are described in the following paragraphs.

 In each of the following cases the addressee will respond to the requesting

 J14.2 message with the appropriate J14.2 message as required by the R/C

 procedures specified in paragraph 4.1.7. However, any J14.0 message

 transmitted automatically within 5 (5-15, 5) seconds in response to a J14.2

 message shall suffice in lieu of a WILCO response.

 In the following cases when a Reference TN is required, and one is not

 available, an index number may be used by those JUs incapable of assigning

 track numbers.

 Requests and responses to requests shall be uniquely identified by the

 combination of Source TN, Addressee TN, and Request Number.

 The associations reported in J14.2 EWAC=8, 9, 28, and 29 messages, and

 disassociation reported in J14.2 EWAC=10, message may be implemented for

 internal system use only. They need not be originated by operator action,

 nor displayed to operators.

 4.5.3.3.1 REQUEST PERIODIC REPORT

 A C[2] EW net participant will transmit a J14.2 message to an EW Net participant

 under its control to request periodic reports (on an EW intercept previously

 reported by the addressed EW Net participant) by specifying the track number

 in Reference TN, setting EW Action Value to value 0, and setting Periodicity

 of the Report to one of the following values:

 1 - Once upon detection.

 2 - Upon detection and at 1 minute intervals.


-----

###### 3 - Upon detection and at 5 minute intervals.

 4 - Upon detection and at 15 minute intervals.

 5 - Upon detection and at hourly intervals.

 6 - Upon detection and in accordance with normal transmit rules

 thereafter.

 The EW net participant (Addressee TN) will respond with a J14.2 (R/C=7)

 CANTPRO message if it does not have R² for the Reference TN. Otherwise, it

 will respond with periodic reports using the J14.0 message and the same

 Reference TN and Request Number value as in the requesting J14.2 message. 
 The C[2] EW Net participant receiving the periodic reports may initiate the J3.7

 Surveillance message on the Surveillance Network PG if the data are

 tactically significant.

 The C[2] EW Net participant that requested the J14.0 message may cancel the

 J14.0 message responses by transmitting a J14.2 message with EW Action Value

 set to value 6.

 4.5.3.3.2 REQUEST AUTOMATIC EVALUATION

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 1 requests an evaluation

 of parameters contained in the accompanying J14.0 message. To provide

 continuity between the requesting J14.2 message, the J14.0 parametric message

 and the responding J14.2 (EWAC=7) message, a Request Number will be provided

 in each initial word. Parameters considered in the automatic evaluation are

 Agile Emitter, Frequency/Frequency Range, Modulation Code, Pulse Repetition

 Frequency/Pulse Repetition Interval, Pulse Width, Jitter, Scan Type, Scan

 Rate, and Polarization. The responding J14.2 (EWAC=7) message may include

 the following data elements: Emitter Function, Emitter Number, Mode Number,

 and Emitter Confidence. Unreported data elements will be represented by No

 Statement.


-----

###### 4.5.3.3.3 REQUEST MANUAL EVALUATION

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 2 requests an evaluation

 of an EW LOB, AOP, or Fix designated by Reference TN, and its parameters as

 included in a previously reported, or if not previously reported,

 accompanying, J14.0 message. Based on information obtained from local

 sensors, comparison of emitter(s) characteristics to intelligence files,

 and/or information provided by remote sources, Emitter Number, Emitter

 Function, Mode Number and/or Emitter Confidence values, if determined, are

 assigned and reported in the responding J14.2 (EWAC=7) message that contains

 the emitter data.

 EWAC=1 and 2 may be functionally combined. They may be designed as a single

 action, e.g., "Request Evaluation", for origination and display. All

 evaluation requests may be transmitted as EWAC=2. Upon receipt of either

 EWAC=1 or 2, the TN and all parameters for which an evaluation is requested

 may be made available for operator appreciation, with the receiving operator

 having the capability to select whether an operator (manual) or computer
 derived (automatic) evaluation will be made.

 4.5.3.3.4 REQUEST UPDATE AND WATCH

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 3 requests the addressee

 to make an initial EW report on the specified Reference TN previously

 reported by the addressee. The length of time the requested update reporting

 is to be performed may be indicated by Time Duration. If Periodicity of

 Report is set to value 0 (No Statement), a single report shall be made, and

 then the addressee shall watch the intercept and report only tactically

 significant changes. In this case Time Duration must be set to No Statement. 

 Determination of tactical significance shall be an operator function, i.e.,

 after the initial report subsequent updates must be operator initiated. The

 addressee shall respond with a J14.2 (R/C=7) CANTPRO message if it does not

 have R² for the Reference TN.

 EWAC=3 is a special case of EWAC=0, i.e., it reports at a periodicity of once

 now and only upon changes considered tactically significant by an operator

 thereafter. Systems may be designed such that EWAC=0 and 3 are functionally

 combined. They may be designed as a single action, e.g., "Request Report",


-----

###### for origination and display, or amplified by a periodicity, which may be a

 watch request as defined above.

 4.5.3.3.5 REQUEST DIRECTED SEARCH

 A C[2] EW Net participant will transmit a J14.2 message with EW Action Value set

 to value 4 to request an EW Net participant or all EW Net participants to

 search designated parameters in a specified sector or area at a specified

 time, and to report the results. The length of time the requested search is

 to be performed may be indicated by Time Duration. The word sequences

 required to designate the search parameters listed below are:

 a. Track Number - J14.2I.

 b. Emitter Function - J14.2I/J14.2C3.

 c. Emitter Number - J14.2I/J14.2C3.

 d. Sector - J14.2I/J14.2C1.

 e. Frequency - J14.2I/J14.2C4.

 f. PRI/PRF - J14.2I/J14.2C8.

 g. Bearing - J14.2I/J14.2C1.

 h. Area of Probability (AOP) - J14.2I/J14.2E0/J14.2C2.

 i. Platform Type - J14.2I/J14.2C5.

 j. Latitude/Longitude/Altitude (if available) - J14.2I/J14.2C2.

 k. Known Threats - J14.2I/J14.2C5.

 The J14.2E0 word shall be sent immediately after the J14.2I word when either

 the Immediate Action Indicator, Minute, Hour, or Time Duration needs to be

 specified.


-----

###### All of the parameters specified in a single J14.2 message with EW Action

 Value set to value 4 or in sequential J14.2 messages containing the same

 Request Number, shall be interpreted together, not constituting separate

 requests. For example, if Emitter Function, Sector, and Frequency are all

 designated in a single J14.2, the request means "Search the designated sector

 for an emitter with the indicated function and frequency". Systems must

 ensure that conflicting or confusing combinations of parameters are not

 designated.

 Reference TN may be set to No Statement, or to the TN of an area to be

 searched, or to the TN of an existing track or intercept for which a search

 is directed. The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 4 shall not

 be used to direct a search for an existing track in a specified area.

 When a sector or bearing search is directed, i.e. when the J14.2C1 word is

 included, the Bearing Origin field shall be set to value 0 and the Track

 Number, Origin field shall be set to the TN of Track Number, Addressee; when

 the message is broadcast the Track Number, Origin field set to No Statement

 and each receiving JU shall use its own position as the origin of its search

 sector or bearing. The Receipt/Compliance field shall be set to value 0 for

 a sector or bearing search addressed to an individual JU, and to value 1 for

 a broadcast sector or bearing search.

 If a J14.2 with R/C set to value 0 directs a search against known threats

 which are not implemented by the addressee, and no other implemented

 parameters are designated, the addressee shall transmit a J14.2 CANTPRO  

 (R/C = 7) message with EW Action Value set to value 4.

 Upon completion of the search with no results, the addressee will transmit a

 J14.2 message to the requesting unit containing the same Request Number and

 Reference TN values as were received, the EW Action Value set to value 11,

 and the Reference EW Action Value set to value 4. If information is

 available after the search, the addressee will transmit a J14.2 message to

 the requesting unit containing the same Request Number value received in the

 requesting J14.2 message. The data acquired during the search by the

 addressee will be transmitted to the requesting unit in a J14.0 message with

 the same Request Number value as was received.


-----

###### 4.5.3.3.6 CANCEL REQUEST

 A C[2] EW Net participant may cancel a previous request by initiating the

 transmission of another J14.2 message to the same addressee indicating the

 request number to be cancelled and EW Action Value set to value 5, and

 Reference EW Action Value set to the EW Action Value of the previous request.

 4.5.3.3.7 CEASE REPORT

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 6 directs the addressee

 to cease reporting on an EW LOB, AOP, or Fix specified in Reference TN. If

 the reports were in response to a previous request, Reference EW Action Value

 shall be set to the EW Action Value of the previous request. If Time

 Duration is set to a value other than No Statement, the reporting shall only

 be interrupted for the specified length of time, beginning either immediately

 after the reception of the J14.2 (Immediate Action Indicator set to value 1)

 or at a specified time.

 4.5.3.3.8 EMITTER EVALUATION

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 7 provides an initial

 evaluation or an alteration to the present emitter evaluation, Mode Number,

 and/or Emitter Confidence of the Reference TN. If the Electronic Warfare

 Coordinator Indicator (EWC IND) is set to value 1, the evaluation is as

 directed by the EWC; otherwise the evaluation is as recommended by a nonEWC

 unit. The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 7 shall be

 addressed to the collective address 00177 octal, except in response to a

 J14.2 (EWAC=20) message or a J7.1 message. In either case, R/C shall be set

 to value 1.

 If the emitter evaluation is in response to a J14.2 (EWAC=1 or 2) evaluation

 request message, the J14.2 (EWAC=7) Request Number and Reference TN fields

 shall be set to the same values as in the received J14.2 (EWAC=1 or 2)

 message, and Reference EWAC field shall be set to value 1 or 2, as

 appropriate.


-----

###### 4.5.3.3.9 PARAMETER ASSOCIATION

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 8 reports that there is

 an association between Reference TN and Associated TN, which have similar

 parametric information, and the detected emissions are deemed to originate

 from the same emitter. If the EWC IND is set to value 1, the association is

 directed by the EWC; otherwise, the association is recommended by a nonEWC

 unit. The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set value to 8 shall be

 addressed to the collective address 00177 octal except in response to a J14.2

 (EWAC=20) message or J7.1 message. In either case, R/C shall be set to value

 1.

 4.5.3.3.10 EMITTER ASSOCIATION

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 9 reports that the EW

 information identified by Reference TN and Associated TN is deemed to be

 collocated, i.e., emanating from the same platform but not the same emitter. 

 If the EWC IND is set to value 1, the association is directed by the EWC;

 otherwise, the association is recommended by a nonEWC unit. The J14.2

 message with EW Action Value set to value 9 shall be addressed to the

 collective address 00177 octal except in response to a J14.2 (EWAC=20)

 message or J7.1 message. In either case, R/C shall be set to value 1.

 4.5.3.3.11 DISASSOCIATION

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 10 reports the

 disassociation of Reference TN from all existing parameter and/or emitter

 associations, leaving the remainder of the associations intact. If the EWC

 IND is set to value 1, the disassociation is directed by the EWC; otherwise

 the disassociation is recommended by a nonEWC unit. The J14.2 message with

 EW Action Value set to value 10 shall be addressed to the collective address

 00177 octal.

 4.5.3.3.12 NO FIND

 When the results from a J14.2 request message with EW Action Value set to

 values 0 through 4, or 13 through 15 are negative, the EW Net participant
 (addressee) shall respond to the C[2] EW Net Participant with a J14.2 message


-----

###### containing the same Request Number, Reference EW Action Value, and Reference

 TN values as received, and EW Action Value set to value 11. When Reference

 EW Action Value is 0 or 3, No Find reports that contact has been subsequently

 lost. Otherwise, No Find reports that no detection has been made. This

 J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 11 shall be addressed to the

 originator of the request, but R/C shall be set to value 1. A J14.2

 (EWAC=11) message shall not be transmitted in response to a J14.2 message

 addressed to the collective addressee 00177(8).

 4.5.3.3.13 RESPONSE TO AN ELECTRONIC WARFARE REQUEST

 EW Action Value set to value 12 in the J14.2 message identifies the

 accompanying J14.0 message as a positive response to an EW directed action. 

 Request Number and Reference EW Action Value will contain the same values as

 received in the request message and, if applicable, Reference TN will contain

 the same value as in the J14.2 request message. If Reference TN in the J14.2

 request message was No Statement, Reference TN in this J14.2 and accompanying

 J14.0 shall be the TN of the data reported. Amplifying data shall be

 contained in a J14.0 message sequence. The J14.2 message with EW Action

 Value set to value 12 shall be addressed to the originator of the request,

 but R/C shall be set to value 1.

 4.5.3.3.14 EVALUATE TRACK

 A J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 13 directs the addressee to

 evaluate the sector specified in Sector Width, which is centered on the

 bearing between the receiving JU and the Reference TN, and whose origin is

 the receiving JU, and to report EA intercepts for the duration of the time

 specified in Time Duration. If Time Duration is No Statement, a one-time

 report is requested. If Sector Width is No Statement, a 360° search is

 requested. A search for specific jammers can be directed by specifying the

 jammer in Emitter Number, or a search within a particular frequency/frequency

 range and/or PRF/PRI can be directed by specifying the frequency/frequency

 range and/or PRF/PRI in the applicable fields. Origin TN in the J14.2C1 word

 must be set to No Statement, and Bearing and Bearing Origin must be set to

 their default values and not processed upon receipt. A unit may service

 multiple track evaluation requests. However, if a servicing unit is limited

 in capability to one request at a time per requesting unit, and a second


-----

###### track evaluation request is received from the same requesting unit, the

 servicing unit shall only service that unit's latest request. If the latest

 request causes the total number of evaluations that the unit can service

 simultaneously to be exceeded, the oldest request is cancelled and the new

 request is serviced.

 4.5.3.3.15 EVALUATE SECTOR

 A J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 14 directs the addressee to

 evaluate the sector specified in Sector Width, which is centered on the

 bearing specified in the Bearing field, and whose origin is the receiving JU,

 and to report EA intercepts for the duration of the time specified in Time

 Duration. If Time Duration is No Statement, a one-time report is requested. 

 If Sector Width is No Statement, a 360° search is requested. Reference TN

 shall be set to zero. A search for a specific jammer can be directed by

 specifying the jammer in Emitter Number, or a search within a particular

 frequency/frequency range and/or PRF/PRI can be directed by specifying the

 frequency/frequency range and/or PRF/PRI in the applicable fields. A unit

 may service multiple sector evaluation requests. However, if a servicing

 unit is limited in capability to one request at a time per requesting unit,

 and a second sector evaluation request is received from the same requesting

 unit, the servicing unit shall only service that unit's latest request. If

 the latest request causes the total number of evaluations that the unit can

 service simultaneously to be exceeded, the oldest request shall be cancelled

 and the new request shall be serviced.

 EWAC=13 and 14 may be combined. They may be designed as a single action,

 e.g., "Evaluate Jamming", for origination and display, with the originating

 operator having the capability to specify a track which is suspected of

 jamming. If no track is specified, the operator must have the capability to

 specify a bearing originating from the addressee. If no track or bearing is

 specified by the operator, the evaluation shall be omnidirectional, and a

 J14.2 (EWAC=14) message with Bearing = 0 and Sector Width = 180 shall be

 transmitted.


-----

###### 4.5.3.3.16 DIRECTION FINDER (DF) REQUEST

 A C[2] EW Net participant will transmit a J14.2 message with EW Action Value set

 to value 15 to an EW Net participant under its control to initiate a DF

 search. Identification of the objective may be specified either by Reference

 TN or by frequency/frequency range. The specific time to take the DF action

 shall be specified in Hour, Minute, and Second of the J14.2E0 word. Upon

 completion of the DF action, a J14.0 message with the same Request Number as

 the requesting J14.2 will be used to report the bearing information. This

 J14.0 message shall be preceded by a J14.2 message with EW Action Value set

 to value 12 containing the same Request Number and with Reference EW Action

 Value set to value 15. The DF request may be promulgated to a group of EW

 Net participants via the collective address. Based on bearing information
 from various reporting units, the C[2] EW JU may report an EW fix in a J3.7

 message.

 4.5.3.3.17 PROTECT REQUEST

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 16 and a frequency/

 frequency range specified by the J14.2C4 word requests that a friendly

 frequency/frequency range used for a particular operation shall be protected

 in order to prevent it from being inadvertently jammed by friendly forces

 while active EW operations are directed against hostile forces. The time and

 time duration of this frequency protection may be specified by Hour, Minute,

 and Time Duration of the J14.2E0 word; if no time and no time duration are

 specified, the frequency/frequency range protection shall last from the time

 of reception of the J14.2 message until either an appropriate cancel request

 is received or until a new protection for this frequency/frequency range is

 ordered. J14.2 messages containing this EW Action Value may be transmitted

 on both the EW NPG and the Weapons Coordination and Management NPG.

 4.5.3.3.18 JAMMING REQUEST

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 17 initiates a jamming

 request against a specified emitter/platform, frequency/frequency range,

 track, or known threats in a specified sector, area or at a specified

 position to a specific JU, or directs the cessation of this kind of jamming. 

 The time and time duration of the jamming may be specified in the J14.2E0


-----

###### word; if no time and no time duration are specified, the jamming shall last

 from the time of reception of the J14.2 message until either an appropriate

 cancel request is received or a new jamming request for the specified

 emitter/platform, frequency/frequency range, track, or known threats in the

 sector, area, or at the position specified is ordered, or until tactically no

 longer required.

 For jamming requests, the specific jamming to be accomplished is specified in

 various ways by the setting of the fields in the J14.2 message as follows:

 a. Reference TN: "Jam Reference TN".

 b. Bearing: "Jam on the bearing" (or if Sector Width is specified,

 "in the sector" which is centered on the bearing specified in the Bearing

 field, and whose origin is the receiving JU, or "in the specific direction",

 if Elevation Angle is included).

 c. Position (specified by Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude (if

 available): "Direct jamming at the specified position."

 d. Area (specified in the J14.2C2 word): "Jam in the specified area."

 e. Emitter Number: "Jam the specified emitter."

 f. Frequency: "Jam the frequency, or frequency range."

 g. Specific known threats (as identified in the fields of the

 J14.2C5): "Jam all threats of the Nationality, Environment/Category,

 Platform, Activity, and/or Specific Type specified" or "Jam the threat

 identified by Local Discrete Identifier." Reference TN must be set to No

 Statement when this method of specifying jamming is used. If Local Discrete

 Identifier is specified, all other fields of the J14.2C5 must be set to No

 Statement.

 All of the fields of the J14.2 which are specified shall be interpreted

 together as a single jamming request. For example, if Bearing and Frequency

 are specified, the addressed JU is requested to jam that frequency on the

 specified bearing.


-----

###### The cessation of jamming is ordered by the J14.2 with EW Action Value set to

 value 17, and Automatic EA Negation set to value 1 and Request Number and

 Reference TN, if applicable, set to the same values used in a previous

 jamming request addressed to Addressee TN. The time of cessation can be

 ordered either by specifying a certain time in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds or

 by setting the Immediate Action Indicator to value 1. If all of these fields

 are No Statement, cessation of jamming is ordered immediately. When

 Automatic EA Negation is set to value 1, none of the J14.2 continuation words

 shall be transmitted.

 4.5.3.3.19 DEPLOY DECOYS

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 19 orders the deployment

 of decoys in a specified sector or area. The type of decoys shall be

 specified in Decoy Type in the J14.2E0 word. The time and time duration of

 the decoy deployment may be specified in the J14.2E0 word; if no time and no

 time duration are specified, the decoy deployment shall last from the time of

 reception of the J14.2 message until either an appropriate cancel request is

 received or a new request for deployment of decoys for the specified sector

 or area is ordered, or until tactically no longer required.

 J14.2 messages containing this EW Action Value may be transmitted on both the

 EW NPG and the Weapons Coordination and Management NPG. Other amplifying

 information about deployment is specified as follows:

 a. Position or area in which decoys are to be deployed using the

 J14.2C2 word.

 b. A corridor or sector along which decoys are to be deployed,

 specified as a line of bearing (with sector width if a sector) using the

 J14.2C1 word.

 c. The frequency or frequency range to be decoyed using the J14.2C4

 word.

 The cessation of decoy deployment is ordered using the J14.2 with EW Action

 Value set to value 19 with Automatic EA Negation set to value 1 and Request

 Number set to the same value used in the previous order for deployment of


-----

###### decoys addressed to Addressee TN. The time of cessation can be ordered

 either by specifying a certain time in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds or by

 setting the Immediate Action Indicator to value 1. If all of these fields

 are No Statement, cessation of decoy deployment is ordered immediately.

 4.5.3.3.20 PARAMETRIC DATA UPDATE REQUEST

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 20 requests that all EW

 parametric data which is not periodically updated at normal intervals be

 reported. Addressed units shall respond as follows:

 a. If Addressee TN is set to value 00177 octal, transmit all J14.0

 data which own JU is reporting in response to a J14.2 (EWAC=0) message with

 Periodicity of Report set to value 3, 4, or 5, or a J14.2 (EWAC=3) message,

 with the J14.0 Response Indicator, EWAC set to value 1. These J14.0 messages

 shall not be preceded by a J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value

 12, nor shall a J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 11 be
 transmitted by JUs which do not have R[2] for any J14.0 data. Transmit all

 J14.2 messages with EW Action Value set to values 7, 8, or 9 which own JU has

 originated and for which the evaluation or association is still effective. 

 Those J14.2 messages shall be addressed to the requesting unit, with R/C set

 to value 1.

 b. If Addressee TN is set to own JU's address, transmit J14.0 data

 which own JU is reporting in response to a J14.2 (EWAC=0) message with

 Periodicity of Report set to value 3, 4, or 5, or a J14.2 (EWAC=3) message

 with the J14.0 Response Indicator, EWAC set to value 1. These J14.0 messages

 shall not be preceded by a J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value

 12. Transmit all locally held EW evaluations and associations in J14.2

 messages with the EW Action Value set to values 7, 8, or 9. These J14.2

 messages shall be addressed to the requesting unit with R/C set to value 1.

 4.5.3.3.21 SET EMISSIONS CONTROL

 Upon receipt of a J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 23, the

 addressed JU shall set the EMCON specified in Plan Source and Plan Number, at

 the time specified, or immediately, as indicated by the Immediate Action

 Indicator in the J14.2E0 word. The duration of the EMCON may be specified,


-----

###### also. The Addressee TN can be either an individual or a collective address. 

 J14.2 messages containing this EW Action Value may be transmitted on both the

 EW NPG and the Weapons Coordination and Management NPG.

 4.5.3.3.22 TRACK NUMBER, REFERENCE/INDEX NUMBER CORRELATION

 A C[2] EW JU will initiate a J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 26

 to inform an EW Net participant that a track number has been assigned to the

 index number initiated by that Net participant. Upon receipt of a J14.2

 message with EW Action Value set to value 26, the addressee will accept the

 track number specified in Reference TN for the track that has been identified

 by the index number specified in the J14.2 message. The Addressee TN shall

 then transmit a J14.0 containing the Reference TN with all current available

 data as a means of informing all other JUs on the EW NPG of the correlation.

 4.5.3.3.23 GUARD REQUEST

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 30, and a

 frequency/frequency range specified by the J14.2C4 word indicates that this

 frequency/frequency range is currently being exploited for combat information

 and/or intelligence and therefore shall not be interfered with by friendly

 forces. The time and time duration of frequency protection may be specified

 by Hour, Minute, and Time Duration of the J14.2E0 word; if no time and no

 time duration are specified, the frequency/frequency range protection shall

 last from the time of reception of the J14.2 message until either an

 appropriate cancel request is received or until a new guard request for this

 frequency/frequency range is ordered. J14.2 messages containing this EW

 Action Value may be transmitted on both the EW NPG and the Weapons

 Coordination and Management NPG.

 4.5.3.3.24 TABOO REQUEST

 The J14.2 message with EW Action Value set to value 31, and a

 frequency/frequency range specified by the J14.2C4 word indicates that this

 frequency/frequency range is of such importance that it must never be

 deliberately jammed or interfered with by a friendly force. The time and

 time duration of frequency protection may be specified by Hour, Minute, and

 Time Duration of the J14.2E0 word; if no time and no time duration are


-----

###### specified, the frequency/frequency range taboo shall last from the time of

 reception of the J14.2 message until either an appropriate cancel request is

 received or until a new taboo request for this frequency/frequency range is

 ordered. J14.2 messages containing this EW Action Value may be transmitted

 on both the EW NPG and the Weapons Coordination and Management NPG.

 4.5.4 TERMINATION OF ELECTRONIC WARFARE PARAMETRIC DATA

 When a JU stops reporting EW information that it has been reporting on the EW

 NPG, it may transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message on the EW NPG.

###### 4.6 AMPLIFICATION

 Amplification information is exchanged in the J6.0 Amplification message.

 The J6.0 Amplification message is used to report information gained by

 collection techniques; i.e., other than those normally associated with data

 link information reporting (radar and sonar contacts and EW detections),

 about surveillance tracks or points that are being reported in other

 messages. Any unit may use this message to provide amplifying information on

 an existing track or point.

 This amplifying information is transmitted by the JU deriving the information
 and is independent of track reporting and R[2]. The SPI field in the J6.0I

 Amplification initial word indicates whether the information contained in the

 J6.0 message requires special processing. The SPI field for this information

 is independent of the basic track message. Additionally, the SPI field value

 must be maintained when information received requires special processing and

 that information is retransmitted, unless all of the retransmitted

 information is derived by local means and does not require special processing

 or a determination has been made that special processing is no longer
 required. R[2], as defined for track messages, is not used for information

 reported in the J6.0 Amplification message. Any JU having information may

 report the most current local information and may report the latest data link

 information received for which no locally derived information is available.

 The procedures for reporting amplification information are described below.

 4.6.1 AMPLIFICATION INFORMATION

 The TN of the track or point which is being amplified is contained in the

 J6.0I word. The specific type and activity amplification index of that TN

 are reported in the J6.0E0 word. When reporting the current activity of the

 track or point, the latest available information is reported redundantly in

 accordance with the message transmission rules. A change in the current

 activity shall interrupt the redundant transmissions. The capability exists

 in the J6.0 message to report pairings or engagements between any two TNs

 regardless of their environment/category. Even though this capability

 exists, it shall not be used to report pairings or engagements which are


-----

###### specified for reporting in the J10.6 Pairing message and the J10.2 Engagement

 Status message. Systems shall not allow the J6.0 messages that report

 pairings or engagements to overlay or replace pairings or engagements

 established by the J10.6 and J10.2 messages. When the display of both types

 of pairings or engagements is implemented, they must be unique so as to avoid

 operator misinterpretation.

 4.6.2 RESET

 The Reset To No Statement value is transmitted only as a result of operator

 action. It is provided to permit operators to change a reported nonzero

 value, in applicable fields except the TN field, to No Statement when the

 reported nonzero value is determined to no longer be valid because of

 erroneous entry; aging of data to such an extent that it is no longer

 tactically significant; the reporting process is no longer occurring; etc.,

 and no other nonzero value for that particular field is appropriate for

 transmission. When a system can no longer support the continued reporting of

 the J6.0 message data due to reasons not associated with the degree of

 validity of the data, such as dropping the tracks due to display

 considerations, technical limitations as to number of tracks on which such

 data can be reported, etc., the Reset To No Statement value shall not be

 transmitted.

 4.6.3 FILTERING OF AMPLIFICATION DATA

 Systems implementing the transmission of the J6.0 message should have the

 capability to filter these messages based upon the setting of the SPI field.

 If the SPI field is set in the J6.0I word and a security filter exists on a

 specific link, the J6.0 message shall not be sent on that link even if a

 track alert exists on the associated track data. If it is determined that

 the J6.0 message data are to be transmitted or forwarded on a link that has a

 security filter, the SPI field must be set to zero or the security filter

 must be removed. The determination to transmit or forward the J6.0 message

 data will be controlled by the interface operating procedures.


-----

###### 4.6.4 TERMINATION OF AMPLIFICATION DATA

 The transmission of Amplification data shall be terminated when the track or

 point being amplified is no longer being reported on the interface. The

 information may be purged in accordance with system design.

 4.6.5 RESPONSE INDICATOR

 When the J6.0 message is being retransmitted as a result of a J7.1 Data

 Update Request message, the Response Indicator field shall be set to 1.

 4.6.6 AMPLIFICATION OF J6.0 AMPLIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

 The following paragraphs provide additional clarification of the primary

 purpose of certain J6.0 data fields.

 4.6.6.1 TRACK NUMBERS

 All track numbers contained in J6.0 messages must exist on the interface in

 other than J6.0 messages, i.e., the J6.0 messages shall not be used to

 originate a track. The primary purposes of the three J6.0 TN fields are as

 follows:

 a. The Reference TN is the track or point about which the amplifying

 information applies.

 b. The Objective TN is a track or point that is being targeted by the

 Reference TN. The specific targeting action being taken by the Reference TN

 against the Objective TN may be reported in the Activity Amplification Index

 field (see paragraph 4.6.6.2).

 c. The TN of the Controlling Agency of the Reference TN is a track or

 point that is controlling or providing direction to the Reference TN.

 4.6.6.2 ACTIVITY AND ACTIVITY AMPLIFICATION INDEX (AAI)

 The Activity field reports the activity currently being conducted by the

 Reference TN. The AAI field reports additional information about the current


-----

###### activity of the Reference TN. The meaning of these two fields depends on the

 Environment/Category (E/C) of the Reference TN. Activity need not be

 reported when reporting AAI, i.e., Activity may be zero when AAI is nonzero. 

 Note that the first ten values (1-10) of AAI for each E/C report actions

 normally associated with engagement. Furthermore, the first ten values of

 Air and Land AAI are specifically designed to represent a normal engagement

 sequence.

 4.6.6.3 LOCAL DISCRETE IDENTIFIER (LDI)

 The LDI field is used to report a number between 1 and 4094, the meaning of

 which has been promulgated separately by Operation Order or other means. The

 LDI field provides additional amplifying information about the Reference TN. 

 It may be used for any such purpose deemed necessary by the operational

 commander, although its use will normally be confined to supporting the

 amplification reporting function. The J6.0 and J14.0 LDI fields are

 independent of each other, i.e.; the operational commander may promulgate two

 separate LDI lists, one to support amplification reporting and another to

 support EW reporting, or the operational commander may specify identical LDI

 lists for the J6.0 and J14.0. If the Reference TN is being reported in both

 a J6.0 and J14.0 message, the LDI field reported in each need not be the

 same. Also, the J6.0 and J14.0 LDI fields are independent of the J7.5

 Special Code I, II, III fields. The Special Code fields are used for a

 similar purpose as the LDI fields, but are normally for general use rather

 than supporting amplification or EW reporting. However, an operational

 commander may specify identical Special Code and LDI lists.

 4.6.7 CONFLICTS BETWEEN J6.0 DATA AND OTHER DATA

 J6.0 information shall be independent of data reported in other messages,

 except the TNs. There is no intent to protect against or to report

 conflicts. For example, the Platform and/or Platform Activity of the

 Reference TN reported in a J6.0 message need not be the same as, or even

 consistent with, the Platform and/or Platform Activity reported for the

 Reference TN in J3 series messages. The protocols in paragraphs 4.7.1.2 for

 Data Differences and 4.7.1.3 for Change Data Orders do not apply to J6.0

 data. However, differences between the locally held Surveillance E/C and the

 locally derived E/C shall be resolved before originating or updating


-----

###### amplification information. If the unit originating amplification information
 also has R[2] for the reference TN, the reported Surveillance E/C and the E/C
 reported in the J6.0 message must be the same. If the unit does not hold R[2]

 for the Reference TN, it shall either change the E/C reported in the J6.0
 message to that reported by the R[2] unit, or transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 1) E/C

 Difference Report, and shall not transmit the J6.0 Amplification message

 until a track report is received with the same E/C as the locally derived E/C

 reported in the J6.0 message. If the received J6.0 E/C does not match the

 E/C of the held TN, the J6.0 message shall be discarded.

 4.6.8 PROCESSING AMPLIFICATION DATA FROM MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES

 Processing of amplification data upon receipt is a system option, subject to

 the J6.0 message Minimum Implementation requirements and Receive Rules, and

 the forgoing rules in this section. Therefore, if remote J6.0 data are

 received from multiple sources about the same track, systems may choose to

 store and display the data from any or all of these sources, and select the

 data to be retained either automatically or manually.

###### 4.7 INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

 Data management procedures are required to insure that all systems can

 properly exchange information when operationally interfaced. These

 procedures are accomplished through the use of Information Management

 messages. These messages are provided to clarify, correct, and control the

 flow of data when necessary. The Information Management messages are:

 a. J7.0 Track Management message.

 b. J7.1 Data Update Request message.

 c. J7.2 Correlation message.

 d. J7.3 Pointer message.

 e. J7.4 Track Identifier message.

 f. J7.5 IFF/SIF Management message.

 g. J7.6 Filter Management message.

 h. J7.7 Association message.

 i. J8.0 Unit Designator message.

 j. J8.1 Mission Correlator Change message.

 4.7.1 TRACK MANAGEMENT

 The J7.0 message is used to effect the following management actions on the

 interface:

 a. Dropping or ceasing to report a track.

 b. Reporting differences in Environment/Category and/or ID.

 c. Changing Environment/Category and/or ID.


-----

###### d. Setting or changing the alert indicators.

 e. Changing the Strength fields.

 f. Changing of Exercise status.

 4.7.1.1 DROP TRACK REPORT

 The J7.0 (ACT = 0) Drop Track Report message is transmitted by the JU with R[2]
 to indicate that the JU with R[2] specified in the Source TN field has dropped

 or has ceased reporting the track specified in the Reference TN field. A

 J7.0 (ACT = 0) message shall not be sent when a track is no longer being
 reported due to a shift in R[2].

 4.7.1.2 IDENTITY (ID) AND ENVIRONMENT/CATEGORY (E/C) DIFFERENCE REPORT

 The exchange of Surveillance data requires procedures to recognize and

 resolve differences in ID and Environment/Category. The J7.0 (ACT = 1)

 Difference Report message indicates that the JU specified in the Source TN

 field has local Environment/Category, ID, Identity Amplifying Descriptor, or

 Exercise Indicator data information different from that currently being

 reported on the track specified in the Reference TN field. The J7.0 (ACT =

 1) Difference Report may also indicate that the transmitting JU has different

 data in the Platform and/or Platform Activity fields; however, differences in

 these fields shall be included only when differences in the

 Environment/Category, Identity, Exercise Indicator, or Special Interest

 Indicator are also being reported for the specified track.

 When a JU receives a Surveillance message or a J7.0 (ACT = 1) message in

 which the air, surface (maritime), or land (ground) Environment/Category and

 ID are different from the local Environment/Category and ID, the

 Environment/Category conflict shall be processed and resolved prior to the

 resolution of the ID conflict. That is, if an Environment/Category conflict

 is detected, no further processing to detect an ID conflict need occur.

 When a JU receives a Surveillance message in which the Exercise Indicator is

 different from local Exercise Indicator data or a J7.0 (ACT = 1) message in

 which the Exercise Indicator is different from the local Exercise Indicator,


-----

###### a conflict exists and the operator shall be alerted for manual resolution. 

 Exercise Indicator conflicts will be resolved prior to ID or Identity

 Amplifying Descriptor Conflict resolution. Identity Amplifying Descriptor

 conflicts are processed in the same manner as ID conflicts.

 4.7.1.2.1 ENVIRONMENT/CATEGORY CONFLICTS

 Only the following Environment/Category changes/differences shall be reported

 on the interface:

 a. Space to air.

 b. Air to space, surface (maritime), land (ground).

 c. Surface to air, subsurface (maritime).

 d. Subsurface (maritime) to surface (maritime).

 e. Land (ground) to air, surface (maritime).

 f. Unknown to space, air, surface (maritime), subsurface (maritime),

 land (ground) (applicable to EW reports only).

 When a JU changes the Environment/Category of a track, as specified above, or

 when a difference report is rejected by an operator action, the information

 shall be reported as follows:

 a. If a JU has R[2], the local Environment/Category shall be transmitted

 in the appropriate Surveillance report.

 b. If a JU does not have R[2], the local information shall be transmitted

 in the J7.0 (ACT = 1) message for conflicts.

 When an R[2] JU changes the Environment/Category of a surveillance entity,

 either as a result of operator initiative or acceptance of a J7.0 (ACT=1)

 Difference Report or (ACT=2) Change Data Order, the decision to retain the

 original TN or report the entity with a new TN shall be in accordance with

 paragraph 4.4.2.8 and the rules specified in Table 4.7-1.


-----

###### If the locally held Environment/Category of a track is different from the

 Environment/Category received in a J3.X or a J7.0 (ACT = 1) message for that

 track, the operator shall be alerted (see Table 4.7-1). This alert shall be

 provided even in those cases where the received Environment/Category is not

 implemented.

 If the local data and the received data differ as to whether the TN is

 assigned to a point or to a track, the operator shall be alerted.

 4.7.1.2.2 IDENTITY DIFFERENCE RESOLUTION

 ID differences occur when a JU holds a local ID on a track (local data) which

 differs from the ID being reported on the interface (remote data). Interface

 procedures are required to recognize and resolve these ID differences. All

 IUs should hold the same ID (common ID) for a given track, and any evaluated

 change by an operator to this common ID should be accommodated by the

 interface. Table 4.7-2 presents the framework for processing these Identity

 differences. An ID conflict exists when the ID difference cannot be

 automatically accepted or rejected. In the case of ID conflicts, these

 differences must be presented to the operators for their evaluation. These

 conflicts may also require voice coordination for final resolution. Operator

 alerts and actions not specifically required by procedures included in this

 section are system options at any time. Receipt of ID data on a TN for which
 the receiving JU does not have R[2] and local positional data is not held will

 automatically be accepted and the remote ID placed in the database for

 retention.

###### a. Reporting of Local ID data Changes. Changes to local ID data will

 be reported on the interface in accordance with the following rules.

 (1) The R[2] unit will transmit the changed identity in the

 appropriate surveillance message at the next transmit opportunity. The

 Identity Difference Indicator shall be set to value 0.

 (2) All other interface units will report the changed ID in a

 J7.0 (ACT = 1) Difference Report message. If the interface unit is in
 control but does not have R[2] for the Reference TN the resultant J7.0 (ACT = 1)

 will have the Controlling Unit Indicator field set to value 1.

 b. Processing of ID Difference Reported in a Surveillance Message. 

 When the ID reported in a surveillance message is different from local data,

 interface units shall take the following actions:

 (1) Controlling Unit. The controlling unit of the track shall

 automatically reject the received ID data and transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 1)

 message with own unit data, and with the Controlling Unit Indicator field set

 to value 1. These actions are taken without regard to the setting of the

 Identity Difference Indicator in the surveillance message.

 (2) Other NonR[2] Units.

 (a) If the Identity Difference Indicator is set to value

 0, the difference shall be resolved in accordance with Table 4.7-2. If

 directed to automatically accept the remote ID, the system shall update the

 local ID with the remote ID. If directed to automatically reject the remote

 ID, the system shall transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 1) with local data. In all other
 cases the nonR[2] unit's operator shall be alerted and the ID conflict will be

 resolved by operator action.

 (b) If the Identity Difference Indicator is set to value
 1, the nonR[2] unit may either:

 1 Follow the actions in Table 4.7-2, but where a

 conflict is indicated the unit shall inhibit transmission of the J7.0 (ACT =


-----

###### 1) message until the surveillance message is received with the Identity

 Difference Indicator reset to value 0, or

 2 Take no action with respect to the reported ID; an

 operator alert may be provided as a system option.

 c. Processing of ID Differences Reported in the J7.0 (ACT = 1)

 Message.

 (1) Controlling Unit. A controlling unit receiving a J7.0 (ACT

 = 1) message which reports an ID of a locally-controlled track different from

 the local ID data shall automatically reject the received ID and originate a

 J7.0 (ACT = 1) message containing the local ID data and with the Controlling
 Unit Indicator field set to value 1. If the controlling unit also has R[2], the

 next scheduled track update by the appropriate surveillance message shall

 contain local data and the Identity Difference Indicator shall be set to

 value 0.

 (2) Other Interface Units. All interface units receiving a J7.0

 (ACT = 1) message from the controlling unit (Controlling Unit Indicator field

 set to value 1) shall automatically accept the remote data for database
 update. The JU with R[2] for the track shall report the updated track

 information in the appropriate surveillance message at the next transmit

 opportunity and shall set the Identity Difference Indicator to value 0. The

 ID received in the J7.0 (ACT = 1) message, with the Controlling Unit

 Indicator field set to value 0, shall be processed in accordance with Table

 4.7-2. Actions by interface units shall be as follows:

 (a) R[2] JU.

 1 If the R[2] JU is directed to automatically accept

 the remote ID, the system shall update the local database and the new track

 data shall be reported in the appropriate surveillance message at the next

 transmit opportunity.

 2 If the R[2] JU is directed to automatically reject

 the remote ID, the system shall discard the message and the track shall

 continue to be reported with local data.


-----

###### 3 If the R[2] JU identifies that an ID conflict exists,

 the operator shall be alerted and the local ID data shall continue to be

 reported in the appropriate surveillance message, with the Identity

 Difference Indicator set to value 1. The conflict will be resolved by manual

 means.

 (b) NonR[2] JUs. NonR[2] JUs may either:

 1 Follow the actions in Table 4.7-2, but where a

 conflict is indicated the unit shall inhibit transmission of the J7.0 (ACT =

 1) until the surveillance message is received with the Identity Difference

 Indicator set to value 0, or

 2 Take no action with respect to the reported ID; an

 operator alert may be provided as a system option.

###### 4.7.1.2.3 USE OF THE PPLI TRACK NUMBER AND IDENTITY INDICATOR IN THE

 RESOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENT/CATEGORY, IDENTITY AND EXERCISE INDICATOR

 DIFFERENCE RESOLUTION

 Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph 4.7.1.2.1 and 4.7.1.2.2, a C[2] JU

 may elect to accept, automatically, changes in Environment/Category, Identity

 or Exercise Indicator received in a track report with the PPLI Track Number

 and Identity Indicator set to value 1, provided the new identity is Friend

 and the locally held identity is not Hostile.

 4.7.1.2.4 PLATFORM/PLATFORM ACTIVITY/SPECIFIC TYPE AND SPECIAL

 INTEREST INDICATOR DIFFERENCE RESOLUTION

 Difference resolution of the Platform/Platform Activity/Specific Type and

 Special Interest Indicator field values is not mandatory. A change in the ID

 of a given track shall include the appropriate evaluation of the

 Platform/Platform Activity/Specific Type and Special Interest Indicator

 fields, and shall be included in the J3.X or J7.0 (ACT = 1) message. When
 accepting a remote ID change, C[2] JUs shall also retain the received values of

 the Platform, Platform Activity, Specific Type, and Special Interest

 Indicator fields, where those fields are implemented, for retransmission and

 operator appreciation. The only exceptions to this rule during the

 resolution of differences are:

 a. For controlling units, see paragraphs 4.7.1.2.2b and c.

 b. When a Platform, Platform Activity or Specific Type value of 0, No

 Statement, is received and a non-zero value is held locally.

 c. When an Air Platform value of 6, Tanker, 7, Tanker (Boom Only), or

 8, Tanker (Drogue Only) is held locally and a different value is received. 

 An operator alert in this situation is optional.

 4.7.1.3 CHANGE DATA ORDER

 Differences in the Environment/Category, ID, Platform, Platform Activity,

 Specific Type, Exercise Indicator and Special Interest Indicator field values

 may also be resolved with the use of the J7.0 (ACT = 2) message. The J7.0


-----

###### (ACT = 2) message is mandatory for reception and the data must be displayed

 to the operator. The received data, if implemented, must be accepted for

 retransmission except as indicated in rule e below. The use of the J7.0 (ACT

 = 2) message requires the following rules:

 a. Transmission of the J7.0 (ACT = 2) message is initiated only by

 operator action. When a JU transmits this message, the JU shall reject any

 received data on that track that differ for a 30-second lock-out period,

 except for ID data from the controlling unit of the track and for processing

 an Exercise Status Order.

 b. Except for processing an Exercise Status Order, once the J7.0 (ACT

 = 2) message has been received and accepted, a JU shall not transmit or

 accept any data on the track which differs from the data received in the J7.0

 (ACT = 2) message until a 30-second lock-out has elapsed. At that time,

 normal track position and information conflict message transmission and

 reception procedures apply. There are two exceptions to the above rule as

 follows:

 (1) After reception of the J7.0 (ACT = 2) message, JUs shall

 accept different data prior to the completion of the 30-second lockout period

 provided the different data from the same source that originated the previous

 J7.0 (ACT =2) message.

 (2) After reception of the J7.0 (ACT = 2) message, JUs shall

 accept different ID data prior to the completion of the 30-second lockout

 period provided the different ID data from the controlling unit.

 c. JUs shall not transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 2) message containing an ID of

 Pending.

 d. Units receiving a J7.0 (ACT = 2) Change Data Order message

 containing an ID of Pending shall not accept that order.

 e. Receiving JUs which do not implement the changed
 Environment/Category and have R[2] on the track must cease reporting the track

 and transmit a J7.0 (ACT = 0) message.


-----

###### f. Controlling units receiving a J7.0 (ACT = 2) message need not

 accept that order if the data is different from that on the locally

 controlled aircraft. Rejection of the J7.0 (ACT = 2) message is discussed in

 paragraph 4.7.1.3.1 below.

 4.7.1.3.1 CONTROLLING UNIT RESPONSE TO CHANGE DATA ORDERS ON

 CONTROLLED TRACKS

 Changes in data need not be accepted on tracks by the JU that is controlling

 the track. If these changes are not accepted, the controlling unit shall

 transmit its locally held data in a J7.0 (ACT = 1) message with the

 Controlling Unit Indicator field set. In addition, if the controlling unit
 has R[2], it shall continue to transmit the locally held ID data in a J3.X

 message.

 4.7.1.4 ALERT INDICATORS

 Two types of alert indicators are used on the interface:

 a. Force Tell Indicator (FT IND). This indicator provides the

 capability to designate certain IUs, tracks, points, and EW data as being of

 particular interest on the interface, and the capability to override all

 operator controllable filters, including security filters.

 b. Emergency Indicator (EMG IND). This indicator provides the same

 capabilities as the FT IND and also defines a condition which requires

 immediate attention or assistance, e.g., an aircraft with an emergency or a

 distressed vehicle.

 The use of these alert indicators depends upon the type of message to which

 they apply, as shown in Table 4.7-3.

 Exercise Friend.

 (2) Automatically set all data fields that may contain

 artificial information (as specified for each message in the appropriate

 paragraphs of this Volume) to the No Statement, default value, or actual

 values if held in database, and set the Exercise Indicator to value 0.

 (3) Break any locally originated engagement involving the TN by

 transmitting a J10.2 (WES = 8) message to report the engagement broken.

 (4) Terminate any locally originated Command message with

 Command values 2, 3, 5, or 7 involving the TN, by transmitting a J9.0 message

 with the Command field set to value 4, Cease Engage, or value 5, Hold Fire,

 if the Engagement Status field is set to value 4, Firing.

 c. All data fields set No Statement or default values, as specified in

 paragraph 4.7.1.6b(2) above, shall remain so set until an operator action is

 taken to change them or a remote report with the Exercise Indicator set to

 value 0 is received which changes them.

 d. After receipt of a J7.0 (ACT = 6) message, all subsequent messages

 received with the Exercise Indicator set to value 1 shall be discarded, and

 no messages with the Exercise Indicator set to value 1 shall be originated


-----

###### until local operator action is taken to reenable the JU to accept and

 originate exercise tracks.

 4.7.1.7 EXERCISE INDICATOR

 The Exercise Indicator and the Identity Amplifying Descriptor field in the

 J7.0 message always refer to the Reference TN.

 4.7.2 DATA UPDATE REQUEST

 The J7.1 message consists of the J7.1I Data Update Request initial word and

 J7.1C1 Data Update Request Additional Addresses continuation word and is used

 to request:

 a. Data on a specific TN by setting the Action, Data Update Request

 field to value 1,

 b. Data by specific request indicator values by setting the Action,

 Data Update Request field to value 0, or

 c. Space track state vector or covariance data by setting the Action,

 Data Update Request field to value 2.

 4.7.2.1 DATA UPDATE REQUEST BY TRACK NUMBER

 The J7.1 (ACT = 1) Data Update Request by TN or (ACT = 2) Ballistic Missile

 Update Request message has the capability to request update information on a

 specific TN. When used for this purpose, the requesting JU initiates the

 J7.1 (ACT = 1 or 2) message with the specific TN in the Reference TN field

 and addressed to a specific Addressee TN(s) or to the collective address of

 00177 octal. The responding JU(s), whether a specific address or collective

 addressee, shall then reply as described below.

 4.7.2.1.1 SURVEILLANCE DATA FROM A JU WITH REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY IN

 RESPONSE TO A DATA UPDATE REQUEST

 The JU with R[2] shall respond with surveillance information upon receipt of a

 J7.1 (ACT = 1) message on a specific TN. This JU shall transmit all data


-----

###### held in the appropriate J3 message, except that covariance data will not be
 included on ballistic missile tracks. A JU with R[2] for a line or area shall

 transmit the entire line or area upon receipt of a J7.1 (ACT = 1) for any TN

 used to define the line or area.

 4.7.2.1.2 SURVEILLANCE AMPLIFICATION DATA FROM A JU IN RESPONSE TO

 DATA UPDATE REQUESTS

 Upon receipt of a J7.1 (ACT = 1) message on a specific TN, the JU(s) that

 have originated surveillance amplification data on the track shall respond

 with the J6.0 Amplification message containing all available data.

 4.7.2.1.3 CONTROLLING UNIT RESPONSE TO DATA UPDATE REQUESTS

 Upon receipt of a J7.1 (ACT = 1) message on a specific TN, the JU controlling

 the TN shall transmit the appropriate J10 Weapons Coordination and Management

 messages and J13 Platform and System Status messages to include the J10.5

 Controlling Unit Report message, the J10.2 Engagement Status message, and the

 appropriate J13 Platform and System Status messages.

 4.7.2.1.4 C[2] JU RESPONSE TO DATA UPDATE REQUESTS FOR OWN TN

 All C[2] JUs receiving a J7.1 (ACT = 1) message containing their own TN shall

 transmit J10.2 Engagement Status messages to report the status of all

 engagements they are conducting and a J13 Platform and System Status message

 to report their own status.

 4.7.2.1.5 ELECTRONIC WARFARE DATA IN RESPONSE TO DATA UPDATE REQUESTS

 If the Reference TN is being reported in a J3.7 message, the reporting JU

 shall transmit all data held in a J3.7 message. Also, if the request is

 collectively addressed, any JU which has initiated an EW evaluation or

 association on the Reference TN in a J14.2 message shall transmit a J14.2

 message with EW Action Value field set to values 7, 8, or 9 addressed to the

 requesting unit with the R/C field set to value 1. If the request is

 specifically addressed, the addressee shall transmit all locally held EW

 evaluations and associations in the J14.2 message with EW Action Value field


-----

###### set to values 7, 8, or 9 addressed to the requesting unit with R/C field set

 to value 1.

 4.7.2.1.6 BALLISTIC MISSILE DATA IN RESPONSE TO DATA UPDATE REQUESTS

 The C[2] JU with R[2] for the Reference TN shall respond with a J3.6 Space Track

 message upon receipt of a J7.1 message with the Data Update Request Action

 field set to value 2, Ballistic Missile Update Request, on a specific TN. 

 The JU shall transmit the data held in the appropriate J3.6 word sequence. 
 NonR[2] JUs shall not respond to a J7.1 (ACT = 2) Ballistic Missile Update
 Request. If an R[2] shift occurs during execution of a DUR response, where the
 Number/Frequency of Updates field is set to value 2 or 3, the JU assuming R[2]

 shall not respond to any prior Data Update Request.

 4.7.2.2 DATA UPDATE REQUEST BY REQUEST INDICATOR VALUES

 The J7.1 (ACT = 0) Data Update Request by Request Indicator message has the

 capability to request information by request indicator values. The message

 is addressed to a specific Addressee TN(s) or to the collective address of

 00177 octal. The desired request indicator values are selectable by the

 requesting JU setting the appropriate request indicator value. Table 4.7-4

 lists the various request indicator information categories available and the
 response messages required by the C[2] JU which originated the data, or by a C[2]
 JU which has R[2] for a J3.0 multi-point area or multi-segmented line (defined

 by more than one J3.0 message) if the Reference Point Data Request Indicator

 is set to value 1.

 4.7.2.3 RESPONSE INDICATORS

 When a JU responds with a J3.0, J3.7 and/or a J6.0 Amplification message, the

 Response Indicator field in these messages shall be set to value 1. This

 field shall provide each JU with the option to process reference point and/or

 electronic warfare/amplification messages that are in response to a J7.1 (ACT

 = 0) message. This reduces the processing required by each JU to clear the

 displays on previously purged points.

 The specific words containing the Response Indicator field are as follows:


-----

###### a. J3.0I Reference Point initial word.

 b. J3.7I EW Product Information initial word.

 c. J6.0I Amplification initial word.

###### 4.7.3 RESOLUTION OF AIR AND SURFACE TRACK DUAL DESIGNATIONS

 a. The recognition and resolution of dual designations require all IUs

 to periodically compare remote tracks to local tracks (and, optionally, to

 common local tracks) to determine if a dual designation has occurred. The

 frequency of such comparisons the criteria for determining that two tracks

 represent the same object, and the correlation rules shall be in accordance

 with section 4.4.4.3.1, Air and Surface Track Correlation. The rules for

 land (ground) and space track dual designation resolution are TBD.

 b. When a C[2] JU recognizes that two tracks which are being reported to

 the interface are eligible for correlation, that JU shall initiate action,

 either automatically or manually, to resolve the dual designation. The

 recognizing JU shall transmit the J7.2 Correlation message requesting all
 other C[2] IUs to perform a correlation of the two tracks. The message

 identifies the TN to be retained and the TN to be dropped. The receiving IUs

 shall accept the requested correlation unless certain prespecified conditions

 exist which require or allow the receiving IU to reject the requested

 correlation or respond with a reverse correlation request. The originating

 JU indicates in the J7.2 message if it has any constraint which would

 prohibit accepting a reverse correlation. The Response Value (RV) field is

 provided for this purpose. When the RV field is set to value 0 it indicates

 a reverse correlation would be acceptable, and when the RV field is set to

 value 1 it indicates a reverse correlation request would be rejected. 

 Receiving IUs desiring to reverse the requested correlation use the RV field

 to determine if a reverse correlation request should be originated or if the

 original correlation request should be rejected. Whenever a correlation

 request is rejected the J7.2 message with the RV field set to value 2 shall

 be transmitted to report the rejection. When the RV field is set to value 3,

 it indicates the correlation was manually initiated and shall be accepted

 unless certain conditions apply which require rejection (see paragraph

 4.7.3.2.c). The rules for the resolution of dual designations are provided

 in the following paragraphs.

 c. All C[2] JUs capable of reporting air or surface tracks shall have the

 capability to transmit and receive all the response values of the J7.2

 message for real-time air and/or surface tracks, which are held locally by

 their system.


-----

###### 4.7.3.1 RULES FOR A C[2] JU ORIGINATING A J7.2 CORRELATION MESSAGE

 a. Whenever a TN pair is determined, to be a dual designation, the

 recognizing JU shall initiate transmission of the J7.2 message with the

 Retained TN/Dropped TN selection in accordance with paragraph 4.4.4.3.1j. If

 a selection conflict occurs due to OCCs on both the Retained TN and the

 Dropped TN the correlation shall be abandoned until the next correlation

 check. The RV field shall be set to:

 value if
 0 there is no OCC on the Retained TN.
 1 the Retained TN has an OCC.
 3 the correlation was manually initiated.

 b. Transmission of a J7.2 message with the RV field set to value 0 or

 1 shall be discontinued upon receipt of a J7.2 message containing one or both

 of the same TNs.

 c. If the originating C[2] JU holds R[2] for the Dropped TN, it shall drop

 the Dropped TN and transmit the J7.0 (ACT = 0) message. The J7.0 (ACT = 0)

 message shall be transmitted after the J7.2 message.

 d. C[2] JUs capable of transmitting the J7.2 message shall have an

 operator selectable capability to deactivate automatic transmission of the

 message.

 4.7.3.2 RULES FOR C[2] JUs RECEIVING A CORRELATION MESSAGE

 The rules to be followed by C[2] JUs receiving a J7.2 correlation request are as

 follows:

 a. C[2] JUs receiving a J7.2 message with the RV field set to value 0 or

 1 shall not accept the requested correlation when local or remote data held

 indicates one or more of the following conditions exist:

 (1) There is a correlation restriction as listed in paragraph

 4.4.4.3.1g. In this case the correlation shall be rejected.


-----

###### (2) The Retained TN and the Dropped TN will decorrelate, i.e.,

 when subjected to the decorrelation criteria once, the tracks would

 decorrelate. In this case the correlation shall be rejected.

 (3) There is an OCC on the Dropped TN as listed in paragraph

 4.4.4.3.1g(7) and the received RV field is set to value 0. The reverse

 correlation shall be transmitted if the new Dropped TN has no correlation

 constraint. If both the Retained TN and Dropped TN have an OCC, the

 correlation shall be rejected.

 (4) There is an OCC on the Dropped TN as listed in paragraph

 4.4.4.3.1g(7) and the received RV field is set to value 1. In this case, the

 correlation shall be rejected.

 b. C[2] JUs receiving or generating a J7.2 message with the RV field set

 to value 2, Correlation Rejection, shall not automatically originate a

 request with the same Retained TN and Dropped TN for a period of 2(1-10,1)

 minutes. When a correlation request is rejected for a manual correlation,

 the JU originating the request shall provide an operator alert as a cue to

 conduct voice coordination. An operator alert in the event of the rejection

 of an automatic correlation shall be a system option.

 c. C[2] JUs receiving a J7.2 message with the RV field set to value 3

 shall automatically accept the requested correlation unless one of the

 following restrictions applies, in which case the correlation shall be

 rejected:

 (1) The two tracks are of a different E/C, or either track has

 an existing E/C conflict.

 (2) One track is simulated and the other is live.

 (3) Both tracks are locally derived real-time tracks.

 Note: After acceptance of a manual correlation the resulting track shall not

 be the subject of automatic decorrelation processing for a period of 5

 minutes.


-----

###### d. C[2] JUs rejecting the requested correlation shall initiate

 transmission of a J7.2 message with the Retained TN/Dropped TN set as

 received and RV field set to value 2.

 e. C[2] JUs responding with a reverse correlation shall transmit the J7.2

 message with the originally received Retained TN and Dropped TN reversed and

 the RV field set to value 1.

 f. C[2] JUs not holding the Dropped TN shall not take any further action.

 g. If the Retained TN is not held but the Dropped TN is held, the

 correlation request shall be processed as follows:

 (1) If the Dropped TN has an OCC, the following action shall be

 taken:

 (a) If RV is set to 0, transmit a reverse correlation with

 RV set to 1.

 (b) If RV is set to 1, transmit a correlation rejection

 with RV set to 2.

 (c) If RV is set to 3, execute the correlation using

 Dropped TN data and Retained TN track number.

 (2) If the Dropped TN does not have an OCC, execute the

 correlation using Dropped TN data and Retained TN track number.

 h. C[2] JUs rejecting a J7.2 message and holding the Dropped TN as a

 local or common local track shall not interpret the J7.2 message as a Drop
 Track message for the purpose of determining R[2].

 i. If the received J7.2 message contains one or both of the same TNs,

 as contained in the transmission of the own unit J7.2 message sequence in

 progress, the following actions shall be taken:


-----

###### (1) If the own unit RV field is set to value 0, 1, or 3,

 discontinue transmission of the own unit J7.2 message and process the

 received message in accordance with rules 4.7.3.2 a through h.

 (2) If the own unit RV field is set to value 2, complete the

 transmission of the message sequence in progress.

 4.7.4 POINTERS

 A J7.3 message provides the capability for C[2] JUs to designate a geographic
 position and up to twenty characters of text on one or more C[2] JU's displays. 

 In the absence of textual clarification the J7.3 message is used in

 conjunction with voice communications. The J7.3 message can be addressed to

 one, multiple, or all IUs. When it is addressed to one JU, the J7.3I Pointer

 initial word contains the specific address. When it is addressed to multiple

 JUs, the J7.3I word contains one address and the J7.3C1 Pointer Additional

 Addresses continuation word can contain up to four additional addresses. 

 Multiple J7.3C1 words can be sent to accommodate more than five addresses. 

 The J7.3C2 and J7.3C3 words are used to provide amplifying textual

 information of up to twenty characters. When a J7.3 message is addressed to

 all JUs, the J7.3I word contains the collective address. The J7.3 message

 can be used to specify one or more operator positions by function within a JU

 through the use of the pointer action data element. There is no TN assigned

 to the pointer; therefore, it must be displayed and dropped by local

 procedure.

 4.7.5 TRACK IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT

 The J7.4 message is used to provide the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

 (NATO) Link 1 TN, the Army Tactical Data Link-1 (ATDL-1) TN, the Link 11/11B

 TN, or the IJMS System Reference Number (SRN) associated with a TN that is

 being reported on Link 16. The J7.4 message can be used to report

 (Report/Request TN field set to value 0) or request (Report/Request TN field

 set to value 1) these TNs individually, collectively, or in any combination.

 A J7.4 message which reports one or more TNs, uses the Track Number

 Applicability indicators to indicate which TN(s) is/are being reported and

 which TN field(s) of the message is/are to be interpreted. A J7.4 message


-----

###### which requests TNs, uses the Track Number Applicability indicator to indicate

 which TN(s) is/are being requested.

 The J7.4 report message is transmitted initially by any JU which assigns Link

 11/11B, NATO Link 1, ATDL-1 TNs, or IJMS SRNs and by those JUs which forward

 tracks from Link 11/11B, NATO Link 1, ATDL-1 or IJMS to Link 16. The J7.4

 report message may also be transmitted by any JU in response to a J7.4

 request message or as the result of operator action. The J7.4 request

 message may be originated by any JU as a result of operator action. After

 any JU responds to the request, other JUs need not respond unless additional

 TNs for different links have been requested and are held for the track. 

 There is no other management of track identifier data. The latest Link

 11/11B, NATO Link 1 TN, ATDL-1 TN, or IJMS SRN received on a track shall

 supersede previously received data.

 4.7.6 IFF/SIF DATA MANAGEMENT AND SPECIAL CODE REPORTING

 Management of IFF/SIF data is required to insure commonality of data between

 the IUs. The J7.5 message with the following action values is used to

 perform this function:

 a. J7.5 (ACT = 0) Clear IFF/SIF message.

 b. J7.5 (ACT = 1) IFF/SIF Difference Report message.

 c. J7.5 (ACT = 2) IFF/SIF Update Request message.

 d. J7.5 (ACT = 3) Special Code message.

 The reporting of IFF/SIF data in conjunction with periodic surveillance data
 is the responsibility of the JU with R[2], while all other JUs without R[2] are

 responsible for monitoring such data and only reporting different data with
 the J7.5 message. In this way the JU with R[2] can be assumed to be reporting

 the most current data available on the interface.

 A code of all zeroes (00 or 0000) is illegal for use as an assigned

 operational IFF/SIF Mode I, II, or III code. Any IFF/SIF Mode I, II, or III

 Code field set to all zeroes indicates that the reporting unit has no data


-----

###### for that mode for transmission. This condition is referred to as the No Data

 status.

 4.7.6.1 UNIQUE MODE II CODE PROTECTION

 The Mode II code requires special consideration because it is a unique

 identifier which can deter erroneous track correlations and alert

 systems/operators to erroneous entries. Therefore, the maintenance of a

 clear tactical picture is dependent, to a certain extent, upon the protection

 and utilization of the Mode II code uniqueness. The following rules apply

 for this purpose:

 a. Software shall inhibit any change to a valid Mode II code for the

 specific local track. However, the initiation or receipt of the J7.5 (ACT =

 0) Clear IFF/SIF message, designating all modes or Mode II code of the

 specified track to be cleared, shall cause the Mode II code status to be

 returned to a No Data status. Automatic tracking systems may maintain the

 Mode II code data, for tracking purposes, until the next Mode II code

 interrogation. When local sensors detect a Mode II code change, it shall be

 treated as a new track.

 b. Operators may be alerted when two or more tracks have the same Mode

 II code.

 c. All unique Mode II codes should be treated as unique tracks.

 4.7.6.2 CLEARING IFF/SIF DATA

 When erroneous codes are detected and there are no other valid codes

 available or changes are inhibited, as in Mode II code reporting, a

 capability to delete or clear the erroneous codes is necessary so that the

 interface can return to a No Data status for the specified track and its

 corresponding mode(s). Accordingly, any JU capable of originating a J3

 message that includes a continuation word containing IFF/SIF data shall also

 have a capability to manually originate the J7.5 (ACT = 0) message. 

 Additionally, any JU capable of maintaining IFF/SIF data in its database

 shall have a capability, upon initiation or receipt of a J7.5 (ACT = 0)

 message, to automatically set the designated mode(s) for the specified track


-----

###### to the No Data status (except for Mode IV as stated below). The following

 rules apply for this function:

 a. Any JU may originate, by operator action only, the J7.5 (ACT = 0)

 message for the clearing of one or more modes on the specified track.

 b. All JUs, upon receipt of the J7.5 (ACT = 0) message, shall

 automatically set the designated mode(s) for the specified track to the No

 Data status (except that acceptance or rejection of a received J7.5 (ACT=0)

 Mode IV Clear message may be automatic or by operator determination). The No

 Data status, if accepted, should be used for all subsequent interface

 functions and data link messages until updated by valid code responses from

 local or remote sources. The operator display shall indicate that a J7.5

 (ACT = 0) message was received.

 c. A JU with R[2], upon receiving or initiating a J7.5 (ACT = 0) message

 that results in no IFF/SIF data being held on the track, shall not continue

 transmitting the periodic J3 message that includes the continuation word

 containing IFF/SIF data.

 d. Any JU may change a local mode to a No Data status without

 transmitting a J7.5 (ACT = 0) message.

 4.7.6.3 IFF/SIF DIFFERENCE RESOLUTION

 Each JU without R[2] shall compare locally held data with IFF/SIF data reported
 by the JU with R[2] and report any valid data that are different, in accordance
 with the rules below. The JU without R[2] shall report current valid changes.

 a. Any JU receiving a J3 message that includes a continuation word

 with remote IFF/SIF data or J7.5 (ACT = 1) message differing from locally

 held data shall respond as indicated in Table 4.7-5.

-----

###### b. Any JU without R[2] entering a change of nonzero to nonzero or zero to

 nonzero value to its locally held Mode I, III or IV IFF/SIF data, or a change

 from zero to nonzero Mode II data, shall automatically report the new data in

 a J7.5 (ACT = 1) message.

 c. Operator alerts, in addition to those specified in Table 4.7-5, may

 be implemented in individual JUs on an optional basis. An example would be a

 JU using manual IFF/SIF inputs that may desire to alert an operator whenever

 its data have been changed by accepting remote data.

 d. When an operator receives an IFF/SIF data conflict alert as

 required in Table 4.7-5, he shall have the following manual actions at his

 disposal for attempting resolution of the difference:

 (1) Update local data manually or verify automatic inputs.

 (2) Initiate J7.5 (ACT = 0) Clear IFF/SIF message (any mode).

 (3) Initiate J7.5 (ACT = 1) IFF/SIF Difference Report message

 (any mode).

 (4) Change local data to agree with remote data except in the

 case of Mode II code.

 (5) Decorrelate the local data from the remote data, causing the

 assignment of a new track number to local data.

 (6) Clear operator alert (any mode).

 4.7.6.3.1 CURRENT/NONCURRENT DATA

 Current IFF/SIF data, as defined for use in Table 4.7-5, are those valid code

 responses that are no more than 40 seconds old since entry into the database

 by automatic or manual inputs. However, systems need not time-tag IFF/SIF

 data for purposes of determining currency. When remote IFF/SIF data is

 accepted in accordance with the difference resolution matrix, Table 4.7-5,

 such remote data will be entered as valid noncurrent data. Systems not

 maintaining currency indicators will assume local track/mode is current if


-----

###### the track/mode is currently being received automatically from own sensors. 

 All other code data shall be assumed to be noncurrent. Processing of Mode IV

 codes is exempt from all current/noncurrent indications.

 4.7.6.4 IFF/SIF UPDATE REQUESTS

 Data updating can occur spontaneously as a result of the R[2] unit reporting a

 No Data status (value 0) for one or more modes in a required IFF/SIF

 Surveillance data report, J3.XC1. Receiving units which hold valid nonzero

 data will respond as required by the IFF/SIF Difference Resolution Matrix,

 Table 4.7-5. Data updating can also occur as a result of an operator action

 wherein the update request is transmitted in a J7.5 (ACT = 2) IFF/SIF Update

 Request message. Units receiving the J7.5 (ACT = 2) message will respond by

 transmitting their local data codes. Rules for the IFF/SIF update function

 are as follows:

 a. The J7.5 (ACT = 2) message shall be manually initiated by R[2] and
 nonR[2] units with the applicable mode indicators set when requesting update of

 IFF/SIF data.

 b. R[2] units receiving the J7.5 (ACT = 2) message will respond by

 initiating a J3.XC1 message regardless of the No Data status.

 c. NonR[2] units receiving the J7.5 (ACT = 2) message from the R[2] unit

 will respond by initiating a J7.5 (ACT = 1) message if valid local data

 (nonzero codes) are held for the requested mode(s). If the requested data

 has been transmitted by another JU, the remaining JUs need not respond with

 their local data.

 d. NonR[2] units receiving the J7.5 (ACT = 2) message from other nonR[2]

 units will not respond to the request.

 4.7.6.5 SPECIAL CODE REPORTING

 The J7.5 (ACT = 3) message is used to exchange codes that have special

 meaning for implementing JUs. The following rules are applicable:


-----

###### a. JUs implementing the special codes capability shall provide

 nonambiguous displays for both IFF/SIF code responses and the special code

 responses. Also, JUs implementing more than one of the special code fields

 shall provide nonambiguous displays which clearly distinguish each type of

 special code from all other types of special codes.

 b. The rules for reporting and managing the J7.5 (ACT = 3) message

 shall be as stated in this paragraph and are not governed by the rules for

 IFF/SIF data.

 c. Any JU may report special codes using the J7.5 (ACT = 3) message to

 initiate, change, or clear such codes.

 d. Any JU clearing one or more of the special codes shall transmit the

 J7.5 (ACT = 3) message with the special code applicability indicator fields

 set and the associated special code fields set to value 0.

 e. JUs implementing the special code capability shall accept all zero

 or nonzero special code values as received.

 f. A JU shall transmit special code information only if data are held.

 g. The JU originating or changing a special code shall assume J7.5

 (ACT = 3) reporting responsibility for retransmission until such time as a

 special code message is received for that track from another unit, or the

 track is dropped, or a clear special code is received.

 h. The JU having or assuming reporting responsibility for the track

 surveillance report shall also have reporting responsibility for nonzero

 special codes if that system implements the J7.5 (ACT = 3) message.

 i. When a JU transmits a J7.5 (ACT = 3) Special Code message all

 nonzero special codes for that track will be reported.

 4.7.7 FILTERS

 Two types of filters are used by a JU, message label/sublabel filters and

 data filters, as described below.


-----

###### a. Message label/sublabel filters may be used to inhibit overloading

 of the terminal-to-host interface, or to reduce demands for TDS processor

 time, on a JU. The message label/sublabel filter shall be considered a

 separate category of filter from data filters, and its use shall not be

 restricted by the data filter rules described in paragraph 4.7.7.8. However,

 use of these filters is restricted to receive only filtering for those

 messages which the JU does not implement due to the mission or particular

 capabilities/restrictions of that platform. The message label/ sublabel

 filter will select messages to be filtered by the Link 16 label and sublabel

 fields, and therefore will not be forwarded to the Host TDS. The J7.6

 message shall not be used to request implementation/deletion or status of

 message label/sublabel filters, and this type of filter will not be reported

 in the J7.6 Filter Description Report. If implemented, the message label/

 sublabel filter shall only be used for the purposes described above, i.e. it

 shall not be used as a data filter. All subsequent subparagraphs of 4.7.7

 refer to data filters and not to the message label/sublabel filter. (A

 message label/sublabel filter shall not be used to avoid the data forwarding

 requirements as set forth in Appendix C, Data Forwarding.)

 b. Data filters may be used to inhibit the flow of data on a data

 link. A data filter that inhibits data from being transmitted on a data link

 is a transmit filter. A data filter that deletes data received on a data

 link prior to entry into an IU database is a receive filter. Interfacing

 systems have certain defined filter capabilities in order to prevent data

 link overload conditions, overload of a system database, and/or undesired

 data from entering a system database. Data filter implementation is optional

 and system constraints may dictate the type of filters used.

 4.7.7.1 DATA FILTER TYPES

 There are five broad filter types as follows:

 a. Environment/Category.

 (1) Unknown.

 (2) Space.


-----

###### (3) Air.

 (4) Surface (Maritime).

 (5) Subsurface (Maritime).

 (6) Land (Ground).

 (7) Reference Point.

 (8) Electronic Warfare.

 b. Identity.

 (1) Pending.

 (2) Unknown.

 (3) Assumed Friend.

 (4) Friend.

 (5) Neutral.

 (6) Suspect.

 (7) Hostile.

 c. Special Processing.

 d. Simulation.

 e. Geographic Area.

 (1) Circle/Ellipse.

 (2) Annulus.


-----

###### (3) Circular Sector.

 (4) Sector of Annulus.

 (5) Rectangle/Square.

 (6) Nested Rectangle.

 (7) Line.

 (8) Other multisided figures.

 4.7.7.2 ENVIRONMENT/CATEGORY FILTERS

 An environment/category filter allows a JU to filter tracks and nonC[2] IUs from

 the space, air, surface (maritime), subsurface (maritime), and land (ground)

 environment/categories, as well as reference points and electronic warfare

 product information.

 4.7.7.3 IDENTITY FILTERS

 An ID filter allows a JU to filter tracks and nonC[2] IUs based on their IDs. 

 Exercise Indicator settings have no influence on ID filters. Identity and

 Identity Amplifying Descriptor are filtered in the same manner e.g., a Friend

 filter would filter both Friend and Exercise Friend, a Hostile filter would

 filter both Hostile and Faker, etc.

 4.7.7.4 GEOGRAPHIC FILTERS

 A geographic filter allows a JU to filter tracks and nonC[2] IUs based on their

 geographic location. Maximum and minimum altitude values may also be defined

 for each filter that make it possible to describe volumes. Filters can be

 fixed geographically, slaved to the filtering JU or some other moving

 reference point, or move independently. (See Table 4.7-6.)

 a. A circle filter is defined by a center point, a major and minor

 axis that are equal, and an axis orientation. When a second set of major and


-----

###### minor axes that are equal and a second axis orientation are used, an annulus

 filter is defined, e.g., a ring-shaped area.

 b. A circular sector filter is defined by a center point, a major and

 minor axis that are equal, an axis orientation, a beginning bearing, and an

 ending bearing. When a second set of major and minor axes that are equal and

 a second axis orientation are used with the same beginning and ending

 bearing, a sector of an annulus filter is defined.

 c. A line filter is defined by two or more points with an indication

 of the direction of filtering from the line. The direction is indicated as

 the true compass quadrant in which a normal to the line in the direction to

 be filtered lies. The entire area extending outward and from both ends of

 the line infinitely will be filtered. For a segmented line, the direction is

 indicated as it applies to the first segment, i.e., the segment described by

 the Latitude; Longitude; and Delta Latitude, 1; Delta Longitude, 1 fields of

 the J7.6 message that has the Line/Area Continuation Indicator, 1 set to

 value 0. Figure 4.7-1 illustrates the method of specifying line filters. The

 shaded area will be filtered. Note that a multisided figure that is not a

 square, rectangle, circle, or ellipse is just a special case of a

 multisegmented line with the first and last points being coincident.

 d. A rectangular filter is defined by a center point, a major and

 minor axes, and an axis orientation. When a second set of major and minor

 axes and a second axis orientation are used, a nested rectangular filter is

 defined.

 e. The area filters also require an indication of whether the

 filtering is being done inside or outside the defined area.

###### 4.7.7.5 SPECIAL PROCESSING FILTERS

 A special processing filter allows a JU to filter data based on the setting

 of the Special Processing Indicator field.

 4.7.7.6 SIMULATION FILTERS

 A simulation filter allows a JU to filter data and IUs based on the setting

 of the Simulation Indicator field.

 4.7.7.7 DATA FILTER RULES

 The data filtering rules at sub-paragraphs a. through i. below apply to C[2] JUs
 and those at sub-paragraphs a. through j. apply to nonC[2] JUs operating on

 Needline PGs:

 a. The use of interface filters shall be coordinated with all IUs to

 minimize track management problems. Coordination of filtering requests may

 be done by voice or other communications media.

 b. Any system which filters tracks/IUs on receipt must establish a

 transmit filter which duplicates the receive filter. In addition, when a

 receive filter is geographically defined, the transmit filter must, where

 possible, be defined to permit the area filtered for transmission to be

 slightly larger than the area filtered for reception so that tracks entering

 or leaving the filtered area may be displayed to the operator to prevent dual

 designations.

 c. If the storage files of a JU are filled and all applicable filters

 have been used, acceptance of the new data shall not be required, regardless

 of its ID or priority. This procedure applies to both real-time and nonreal
 time data.

 d. Any track or nonC[2] IU with an EMG IND or FT IND set to the value of

 1 shall not be filtered. A J3.1 message shall not be filtered.


-----

###### e. Active nonsimulated C[2] IUs cannot be filtered. In other words, C[2]

 IUs with the Simulation Indicator field set in their J2 PPLI message may be

 filtered.

 f. All filters are identified by filter number for coordination with

 other JUs.

 g. Tracks are eligible for transmission on the interface only if they

 are not inhibited from transmission by any of the transmission filters

 currently set.

 h. Filters shall apply to tracks initiated prior to filter activation

 as well as to tracks initiated while the filter is active. When a transmit

 filter is activated by a unit, the unit shall cease reporting any track for
 which it has R[2] and which meets the filter criteria, and shall comply with the

 rules for terminating transmission of the applicable track data of the

 applicable Environment/Category.

 i. The J7.2 Correlation message shall not be inhibited by any filter.

 j. Targets reported in J12.7 messages shall be processed as EW Product

 information for the purposes of environment/category filtering.

 4.7.7.8 FILTER MESSAGE

 Management and reporting of Link 16 transmit filters are accomplished using

 the following messages:

 a. J7.6 (ACT = 0) Filter Implementation Request message.

 b. J7.6 (ACT = 1) Filter Description Report message.

 c. J7.6 (ACT = 2) Delete Filter Request/Report message.

 d. J7.1 (ACT = 0) Data Update Request by Request Indicator message.

 The J7.6 message only applies to transmit filters as defined in paragraph

 4.7.7, i.e., it is only used to request or report the insertion or deletion


-----

###### of transmit filters including data forwarding filters. The Filter Unit Type

 field indicates whether the filter applies to individual JU transmissions or

 forwarding unit transmissions of forwarded data. The use of receive filters

 is neither requested nor reported via Link 16. Forwarding unit filters

 requested or reported are only those used for filtering transmissions

 originating on Link 16. Filters for forwarding data from any other link to

 Link 16 are neither requested nor reported via Link 16.

 Voice coordination is required in addition to the filter message to ensure

 filter management on the interface.

 4.7.7.8.1 FILTER IMPLEMENTATION REQUEST

 The J7.6 (ACT = 0) message is used by a JU to request that a filter be

 implemented by another JU. The implementation request consists of specifying

 the filter types and the parameters for each type and whether to filter

 inside or outside the defined area, with Filter Number field set to value 0. 

 If specific filters have been prearranged, then an implementation request may

 consist of specifying the filter number with all Filter Indicator fields of

 the J7.6 (ACT = 0) set to value 0.

 4.7.7.8.2 FILTER DESCRIPTION REPORT

 The J7.6 (ACT = 1) message is used by a JU to report a filter which the JU

 has inserted into its TDS or to respond to a J7.1 (ACT = 0) message. The

 filter number shall be set to a value between 1 and 14. When used in

 response to a J7.1 (ACT = 0) message, the filter message(s) shall be

 addressed to the JU requesting the filter information.

 A new filter report on a previously received filter number from a JU shall

 supersede prior filter data for that number. In the case of a line or area

 filter requiring multiple messages all with the same filter number to

 describe the line or area, all of the messages must be treated as a single

 filter report.


-----

###### 4.7.7.8.3 INTERPRETATION OF FILTER REQUEST/REPORTS

 The following rules specify the interpretation and interrelationships of the

 various Filter Indicators in the J7.6I word. The phrase "are filtered" used

 below means "shall be filtered" in J7.6 (ACT = 0) Request, or "is being

 filtered" in a J7.6 (ACT = 1) Report. All of the below listed rules are

 subject to the restrictions in paragraphs 4.7.7.8d and e.

 a. Transmit filters requested or reported in the J7.6 message apply to

 four classes of data as follows:

 (1) Tracks - Tracks reported in J3.2 through J3.5 messages and
 nonC[2] IUs reported in J2.0 and J2.2 through J2.6 messages if Friends are
 filtered. The term "tracks" used herein includes nonC[2] IUs unless otherwise

 indicated.

 (2) Reference Points - Reference points, lines, and areas

 reported in J3.0 messages.

 (3) Electronic Warfare Product Information - Reported in J3.7

 messages.

 (4) Targets - Targets reported in J12.6 and J12.7 messages on

 Needline PG.

 b. Filters requested or reported in the J7.6 messages do not apply to

 any messages other than the J2, J3, and J12 (on Needline PG) series messages
 listed above, e.g., J2 series PPLI data for C[2] IUs, J6.0 Amplification data,
 J14.0 EW Parametric data, etc., except a simulation filter applies to C[2] IUs.

 c. Track filters shall be requested/reported in separate J7.6 messages

 from reference point and EW product filters, with the following exception: 

 if in a track filter message the Unknown E/C Filter Indicator is set to value

 1, then EW product data with Unknown E/C shall be filtered in addition to any

 other valid filter combination contained within that message. Valid

 combinations of filter indicators for tracks, together with their meanings,

 are given in Table 4.7-7.


-----

###### d. Since reference points have no E/C or ID, point filters shall be

 requested/reported in separate J7.6 messages from tracks and EW product

 information, i.e., if the Reference Point Filter Indicator is set, the only

 other Filter Indicators that may be set are the SPI and Simulation Filter

 Indicators and, if required, a Geographic Area Filter. Valid combinations of

 filter indicators for reference points, together with their meanings, are

 given in Table 4.7-8.

 e. EW product information filters shall be requested/reported in

 separate J7.6 messages from tracks and points except that if the Unknown E/C

 filter is set, then Unknown EW product information are filtered regardless of

 the setting of the EW Filter Indicator. When the EW Filter Indicator is set,

 then all other Filter Indicators set in the same message apply only to EW

 product information data. Valid combinations of filter indicators for EW

 products, together with their meanings, are given in Table 4.7-9.

 f. If a Geographic Area Filter is set and the EW Filter Indicator is

 set, then all EW Fixes within/out the area and all EW AOPs having their

 center within/out the area and all EW LOBs with origin within/out the area

 are filtered.

 g. If a Geographic Area Filter is set and the Reference Point Filter

 Indicator is set, then all points within/out the area, all lines with all

 points within/out the area, and all areas completely within/out the area are

 filtered.

 4.7.7.8.4 MOVING FILTERS

 Moving filters are specified using the J7.6I Slaved Indicator and the J7.6C3

 continuation word. The Slaved Indicator must be set to value 1 if the J7.6C3

 word is included. If the filter is slaved to an existing TN, the TN shall be

 reported as TN, Related with Course and Speed set to No Statement. If

 Latitude and Longitude in the J7.6EO are set to No Statement, then the

 position of TN, Related shall be used instead of the J7.6E0 Latitude and

 Longitude. If the filter is to move independently of any other TN, then TN,

 Related shall be set to No Statement with Course and Speed specified. 

 Movement of the filter shall begin at the time of transmission of the J7.6

 (ACT = 1) filter description report. If fixed geographic points are used in


-----

###### the initial filter description, they shall be updated in any subsequent

 reports of the same filter based on the movement of TN, Related or the

 filter's course and speed.

 4.7.7.8.5 DELETE FILTER REQUEST/REPORT

 The J7.6 (ACT = 2) message is used by a JU to request that a filter or all

 filters be deleted by an addressed JU. A JU may also report the deletion of

 one or all of its filters with this message. A TN address of 00177 octal

 shall be used when a JU deletes a filter. A filter number of 15 shall be

 used to indicate all of a JU's filters.

 4.7.7.8.6 DATA UPDATE REQUEST

 The J7.1 (ACT = 0) message shall be used by a JU requesting information on a

 filter. When used, the J7.1 (ACT = 0) message shall be addressed to a

 specific JU; i.e., the collective address of 00177 octal shall not be used. 

 The JU receiving the request shall transmit either all locally inserted

 filters in response to Filter Number equal to 15 or parameters on a specific

 filter as specified by the Filter Number field in the J7.1 (ACT = 0) message. 

 The J7.1 (ACT = 0) Filter Number field shall not be set to value 0 when the

 Filter Data Request Indicator is set to value 1.

 4.7.7.8.7 TERMINATION OF FILTERS

 When a JU deletes a filter which it had reported, it should transmit a J7.6

 (ACT = 2) message. Remote filters shall be dropped when a J7.6 (ACT = 2)

 message is received.

 4.7.7.8.8 PURGING OF FILTER REQUESTS

 Filter messages are nonredundant messages, and each JU should have the

 capability to drop remote filter reports from its own system.

 4.7.8 DATA ASSOCIATION

 The J7.7 message provides the capability to indicate that two TNs or the

 information defining two TNs is associated with the same contact. For


-----

###### example, the association of an air track with an ES report could indicate

 that the designated air track is the source of the ES data. The association

 of a ballistic missile track with a missile launcher is another example of

 data association. The J7.7 message shall not be used to correlate two TNs or

 to pair a TN to any other TN. The J7.7 message is totally independent of the

 J6.0, J10.6, J7.2, and J10.2 messages and may be transmitted concurrently

 with those messages.

 4.7.8.1 TERMINATING ASSOCIATION

 An association shall be terminated by the JU which had originated the

 association when it is determined that the association no longer exists.

 4.7.8.2 PURGING ASSOCIATION DATA

 The J7.7 message is transmitted periodically and JUs should purge received

 data if data have not been updated after a specified time. This time

 interval is optional.

 4.7.9 UNIT DESIGNATOR MANAGEMENT

 The J8.0 message provides the capability to relate a unit designator with an

 IU TN. In an NCS community where changes in Needline PGs can occur after

 initialization, an NCS must manage, drop, or add unit designators to be

 associated with JU or RU TNs.

 4.7.10 MISSION CORRELATOR MANAGEMENT

 The J8.1 message provides the controlling unit the capability to add, delete,

 or change the mission correlator (MC) of TNs under its control. (See

 paragraph 4.10.1.1, Mission Correlator, for information concerning the

 tactical application of mission correlator.)

 4.7.10.1 MISSION CORRELATOR CHANGE FIELD

 The Mission Correlator Change field allows for:

 a. The assignment of one MC.


-----

###### b. The deletion of the assigned MC.

 c. The change of the assigned MC to another MC.

 4.7.10.2 USE OF THE J8.1 MISSION CORRELATOR FIELDS

 When initially assigning or deleting a mission correlator, the Mission

 Correlator field in the J8.1 message contains the MC number to be assigned or

 deleted, and the Mission Correlator, New field is set to No Statement. When

 changing a previously assigned mission correlator, the Mission Correlator

 field contains the previously assigned MC number, and the Mission Correlator,

 New field contains the new MC number.

###### 4.8 ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE

 This section describes the relationship of Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW) to

 command, control, and surveillance. Those portions of the Link 16 interface

 design that support ASW are contained in appropriate portions of paragraphs

 4.4, Surveillance; 4.10, Mission Management; 4.11, Weapons Coordination and

 Management; and 4.12, Control. Link 16 provides the vehicle by which

 parametric data may be exchanged between collectors (ASW assets) and analysis

 centers (ASW nodes) as well as the exchange of product data between ASW nodes

 and other JUs. The following describes the Link 16 interface design ASW

 capabilities. The Link 16 interface design provides for:

 a. Capabilities to meet the requirements for conducting ASW

 operations.

 b. Capabilities to provide ASW support to other warfare areas. These

 capabilities include but are not limited to:

 (1) Coordination and control of ASW operations.

 (2) Exchange of acoustic and other parametric data to support

 the development of:

 (a) Tactical plot information.

 (b) Threat identification.

 (c) Threat assessment.

 ASW can be conducted as an independent operation or as part of coordinated

 operations in close support of a task force. The interface has been designed

 to provide maximum flexibility in the rules for reporting information related

 to ASW in order to allow for differences in the ASW mission.


-----

###### 4.8.1 DEFINITIONS

 4.8.1.1 ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW)

 Antisubmarine warfare involves the use of military assets to search for,

 detect, locate, track, classify, and attack/destroy a submarine threat to

 friendly forces.

 4.8.1.2 SUBSURFACE SURVEILLANCE

 Subsurface surveillance is the reporting of subsurface information to support

 the compilation of the general surveillance picture and the conduct of ASW.

 4.8.1.3 NONANTISUBMARINE WARFARE COMMAND AND CONTROL JTIDS/MIDS UNITS

 NonASW C[2] JUs are C[2] units that have no organic ASW capability other than to: 

 (1) request ASW product data, (2) use ASW product data in their own

 surveillance systems, (3) coordinate activities of weapon systems with other
 C[2] JUs, and (4) control nonC[2] weapon platforms.

 4.8.1.4 COMMAND AND CONTROL JTIDS/MIDS UNITS (ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE

 NODE)

 C[2] JUs (ASW node), in addition to the usual C[2] functions, possess organic ASW

 processing capability. An ASW node has the capacity to collect, coordinate,

 and analyze parametric data and derive product data.

 4.8.1.5 NONCOMMAND AND CONTROL JTIDS/MIDS UNIT (ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE

 ASSET)

 NonC[2] JUs (ASW asset) may be either an ASW collecting/reporting unit or an ASW

 weapons platform. ASW assets may communicate with ASW nodes and/or with one

 another.

 4.8.2 ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE MESSAGE DESCRIPTIONS

 ASW related messages are listed in Table 4.8-1. The number and name of each

 message is listed in the left column of the table. In the two columns


-----

###### immediately to the right of the message number and name are the purpose and

 reference paragraph numbers for related information about that particular

 message. These messages will be supplemented, when necessary, by other

###### situation. At higher levels, this means that C[2] IUs may reassign ASW assets
 in real-time to new missions in support of other C[2] IUs, not only in

 performing limited ASW functions but even to the extent of overall assignment

 changes. Such flexibility implies the capability to dynamically update both

 parametric and product databases and to disseminate information among

 subscribers.

 Accordingly, ASW data exchange on Link 16 is characterized in several ways. 

 Data flow design permits dynamic, real-time reaction to situations. Data
 dissemination design permits integration of nonC[2] ASW assets, C[2] IUs and other
 IU assets, as well as the exchange of ASW data between C[2] IUs. There are

 provisions for requests and commands concerning ASW data and for ASW action
 among C[2] IUs, nonC[2] ASW assets, and nonC[2] weapons platforms. ASW participants

 will be able to perform their missions in close coordination with other

 combat units participating in the tactical warfare.

 Systems implementing Subsurface Surveillance may also use ASW data to support

 threat determination. The information exchange within the Subsurface

 (Maritime) Track and Acoustic Bearing/Range messages satisfies the needs of

 command, control, coordination, and surveillance systems.

 There are requirements for the exchange of parametric ASW data for

 association purposes and to support weapon employment decisions. Those

 parametric data may be obtained from real-time, on-scene measurement or from

 library held values of ASW nodes. When available and requested, whether

 preplanned or ad-hoc, parametric data may be associated with any track. 

 While multiple acoustic frequencies generated by one target platform may be

 concurrently associated with one track, ASW nodes with that information would

 tailor or limit the data to the minimum needed by the requesting unit to

 accomplish its mission. ASW nodes may be tasked to provide timely bearings

 to support targeting.

 ASW acoustic bearings and/or ranges are reported routinely for correlation,

 coordination, or other purposes. When they are the only means of locating

 the threat/target/object, single ASW bearings and/or ranges may be reported

 on the Surveillance Network PG. The data passed over the Surveillance

 Network PG will normally be limited to product information.


-----

###### ASW acoustic bearings and/or ranges, either singularly or in conjunction with

 other types of lines or bearings, may be used to establish fixes from which

 vehicular tracks may be developed. ASW nodes will report fixes over the

 Surveillance Network PG. ASW tracks derived from sequential fixes will be

 reported on the Surveillance Network PG in the J3.4 message.

 Tactically significant ASW information including parametrics may be passed on

 the Surveillance Network PG.

 4.8.4 ASW MISSION DATA

 Described within this section are those messages used to provide data in

 support of the ASW mission. The messages described in this section are:

 a. J3.0 Reference Point message for transmission of ASW points, lines,

 areas, and sonobuoys.

 b. J5.4 Acoustic Bearing/Range message.

 4.8.4.1 ASW POINTS, LINES, AND AREAS

 A C[2] JU shall also be capable of reporting ASW Points on the Surveillance net

 as appropriate or when sufficient data to report a subsurface track may not

 be available. The ASW Reference Point types are contained in the Point

 Type/Point Amplification table used in the J3.0 message.

 This information can be associated with other data for the purpose of

 developing a subsurface track reported on the Surveillance net.

 The J3.0 message is also used to report the location and amplification data

 of deployed sonobuoys. This information is used for mission planning and
 coordination of ASW assets. A C[2] JU shall also be capable of reporting a

 sonobuoy pattern reference position and type of sonobuoy pattern barrier on

 the Surveillance net.


-----

###### 4.8.4.2 ACOUSTIC BEARING/RANGE MESSAGE

 The J5.4 Acoustic Bearing/Range message provides the capability of reporting

 lines-of-bearing and/or ranges to a detected submarine or surface vessel. 

 The use of this message is intended to furnish the bearings/ranges from ASW

 sensors on board surface vessels or ASW sensors aboard aircraft. The setting

 of the Bearing Report Type and Sensor fields is critical to the analysis of

 the bearings produced by either of the above platforms, leading to decisions

 for reporting of a track in a J3.4 Subsurface (Maritime) Track message. 

 Associated acoustic parametric information may be provided to correlate with

 other data for the purpose of developing a subsurface track reported on the

 Surveillance Network PG. Additionally, the J5.4 message may be used to

 report acoustic bearings/ranges on the Surveillance Network PG when deemed

 tactically significant.

 4.8.5 EXERCISE INDICATOR

 The Exercise Indicator and the Identity Amplifying Descriptor fields in the

 J5.4 message always refer to the Reference TN.


-----

###### 4.9 THREAT WARNING

 Threat warning information is exchanged on the interface using the J15.0

 Threat Warning message.

 4.9.1 THREAT WARNING PROCEDURES

 a. Threat warning information is exchanged on the interface to provide

 immediate notification of impending hostile threats. The Threat Warning

 message is originated by any JU having knowledge of a threat to either a JU
 or another friendly track/point, and is independent of track reporting and R[2]. 
 NonC[2] JUs shall only initiate a J15.0 message if the Threat TN is already

 being reported on the interface. Threat warning information shall be

 exchanged on the Surveillance NPG. The J15.0 shall be used to initiate a

 track when immediate notification is necessary and the threat track is not

 currently being reported on the Surveillance NPG. If a J15.0 is used to

 initiate a track, the initiating unit shall also report the threat in a J3

 series message if the threat still exists. The Threat TN shall be used in

 the J3 series message to allow for TN continuity. The Threat TN shall be the

 same as the surveillance track when the surveillance track already exists on

 the interface.

 b. When the J15.0 is used to initiate a track, Threat Posture set to

 value 5, Cancel, shall be used as a "drop track" if a surveillance track has

 not been initiated. If a surveillance track has been initiated, Threat

 Posture = 5 applies to the J15.0 only and has no relation to the J3 series

 message being transmitted.

 c. Upon receipt of a J15.0, JUs shall break all local filters on the

 Threat TN.

 4.9.2 THREAT WARNING ADDRESSING

 a. When possible, the message should be addressed to the unit

 responsible for protection of the targeted unit. When the target is the

 addressed unit, the Targeted TN shall be the Addressee TN.

 b. The J15.0 shall be addressed to the collective address when:


-----

###### (1) The message originator is in doubt as to the unit assigned

 to protect the targeted unit.

 (2) When the Targeted TN is not a JU and it is tactically

 advantageous for multiple platforms to be alerted to a threat against an

 individual platform, e.g., High Value Asset.

 (3) The threat is general in nature and applies to many or all

 JUs and friendly tracks/points. (In this case, Targeted TN shall be set to

 No Statement).

 c. It should be noted that although the message may be addressed to an

 individual platform, it may be advantageous to be addressed to the collective

 address since it is often tactically desirable for multiple platforms to be

 aware of a threat against an individual platform, e.g. High Value Assets.

 4.9.3 THREAT WARNING MESSAGE CONTENTS

 a. The J15.0 Threat Warning message contains information to warn a

 unit or group of units of an impending hostile threat and shall include

 sufficient information to establish a track file. This allows the operator

 to decide what tactics might be employed to counter the threat. The message

 includes but is not limited to the following information:

 (1) Addressee TN (collective or as reported in PPLI).

 (2) Threat TN (either originated or as reported in

 Surveillance).

 (3) Targeted TN (as reported in PPLI or Surveillance).

 (4) Threat Posture, e.g., Search/Surveillance, Ready to

 Launch/Fire, Directed to Engage, Cancel.

 (5) Threat Type, e.g., Aircraft, Ship.

 (6) Threat Weapon, e.g., Heat Air-to-Air Missile, HARM.


-----

###### (7) Location of Threat.

 (8) Course, Speed, Altitude, Threat Fuel state.

 (9) Threat Strength (Raid Size).

 (10) Specific Type of Threat, e.g., Mig 21, SA-6.

 b. The Exercise Indicator field is used in conjunction with the Threat

 TN field and will always be set the same as in the surveillance message

 reporting that track.

 4.9.4 TIMELINESS

 a. It is imperative that the warning of the threat be received on a

 timely basis. This implies several characteristics in the processing of the

 message:

 (1) It must not be filtered.

 (2) Priority of the data should assure transmission ahead of any

 other type of data. Response time shall be the minimum time allowed.

 (3) The J15.0 message shall be transmitted on the Surveillance

 Network PG.

 4.9.5 RELATING THREAT WARNING INFORMATION

 a. Threat warning of affected targets or tracks consists of coupling

 the Targeted TN with the Threat TN. As such, the Targeted TN must be an

 active surveillance track, point, or PPLI except when the Threat is general

 in nature (addressed to the collective address) when the Targeted TN may be

 No Statement, see paragraph 4.9.2b(3).

 b. Since the capability exists in the J15.0 message to report hostile

 to friendly couplings between two TNs regardless of environment/category, the

 J15.0 shall not be used to report pairings or engagements that are specified

 for reporting in the J10.6 Pairing message or the J10.2 Engagement message. 


-----

###### Systems shall not allow the J15.0 message that couples two TNs to replace

 pairings or engagements established by the J10.6 or J10.2 messages. When

 display of both types of couplings or pairings/engagements is implemented,

 i.e., J10.6/J10.2 and J15.0, they must be unique so as to avoid operator

 misinterpretation. J15.0 couplings may overlay J6.0 pairings and

 engagements.


-----

###### 4.10 MISSION MANAGEMENT

 Commanders must manage resources to effectively employ weapon systems to meet

 operational objectives in a dynamic tactical environment. The Mission

 Management function on Link 16 provides for the exchange of information
 between C[2] JUs necessary for monitoring tactical situations and requesting and

 responding to requests for immediate support requirements. This includes,

 but is not limited to, those reports and statuses required by the tactical

 commander to effect mission requests; air, surface (maritime), subsurface

 (maritime), land (ground) tasking orders; sortie allotments; mission

 employment and allocation; and in-flight and mission reports. Normally, the

 command level that implements this functional area does not directly control

 weapon systems but is responsible for the timely allocation of resources
 between subordinate C[2] JUs. This function shall be supported principally by

 voice, teletype or character-oriented data links; however, certain requests,

 reports and other information may be required in real-time or near real-time.

 4.10.1 MISSION MANAGEMENT INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS

 Table 4.10-1 lists the elements of information exchanged within the Mission

 Management function. Information requirements may translate into one or more

 data elements and may require more than one word or message to exchange all

 of the elements.

 4.10.1.1 MISSION CORRELATOR

 A mission correlator is a unique number assigned to all JUs participating in

 a specific overall mission. This number allows the identification and

 isolation of the associated JUs. The mission correlator is not synonymous

 with the mission number assigned to a specific aircraft or flight of

 aircraft. The mission correlator may be the same for numerous mission

 numbers. For example, one mission correlator would be assigned to a strike

 mission and the supporting, i.e., pre- and post-strike tankers, CAP aircraft,

 EW support aircraft, an aircraft for that strike and the forward air

 controller (FAC) aircraft. Through display filtering by mission correlator,

 all the mission participants can be identified.

 4.10.2.3 AIRFIELD STATUS MESSAGE

 The J13.0 Airfield Status message is used to report significant changes in

 the capability of an airbase with its supporting facilities or an aircraft

 carrier, to support joint operations and to conduct planned or anticipated

 operations.

 4.10.2.4 FIRE SUPPORT COORDINATION MEASURES MESSAGE

 The Fire Support Coordination Measures message (TBD) is used to inform C[2] JUs,

 in near-real-time, of current significant fire support coordination measures,

 such as FLOT, FEBA, FSCL, airspace coordination areas, and no fire areas.

 4.10.2.5 IMMEDIATE REQUEST FOR SUPPORT MESSAGE

 immediate mission requests as close air support (CAS), artillery fire,

 reconnaissance, search and rescue, and tactical airlift.

 4.10.2.6 WEATHER OBSERVATION/FORECAST MESSAGE

 The Weather Observation/Forecast message (TBD) is used to inform C[2] JUs of

 current weather observations or forecasts within the tactical operational

 area.

 4.10.2.7 SEVERE WEATHER REPORT MESSAGE

 The Severe Weather Report message (TBD) is used to inform C[2] JUs of severe

 weather conditions that may impact tactical operations.


-----

###### 4.10.2.8 ATMOSPHERIC WEATHER REPORT MESSAGE

 The Atmospheric Weather Report message (TBD) is used to inform C[2] JUs of

 weather conditions of specified atmospheric levels.

 4.10.3 MISSION MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS

 Procedures and protocols for this area remain to be determined.


-----

###### 4.11 WEAPONS COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT

 The Weapons Coordination and Management function includes those activities

 required to accomplish weapons employment and to prevent mutual interference

 during tactical operations. Operational commanders (OPNL CDRs) must have the

 capability to direct the activities of controlling units and the employment

 of weapons. Controlling units must have the capability to coordinate their

 control actions and to transfer control of weapons systems to other

 controlling units in real-time. The Weapons Coordination and Management
 function on Link 16 provides information exchange between C[2] JUs that manage

 or directly control both weapons systems (e.g., fighter aircraft, surface-to
 air missiles (SAMs), etc.) and support platforms (e.g., reconnaissance,

 cargo, etc.). The Weapons Coordination and Management function is monitored
 by nonC[2] JUs as necessary to compile the tactical picture. However, nonC[2] JUs

 do not originate Weapons Coordination and Management data. The Weapons

 Coordination and Management function is interactive with the Control function

 and the Mission Management function. It is supported by the PPLI function,

 the Surveillance function, and the EW/Intelligence function.

 4.11.1 WEAPONS COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION EXCHANGE

 REQUIREMENTS

 Table 4.11-1 lists the elements of information exchanged within the Weapons

 Coordination and Management function. The purpose of the table is to provide

 general comprehension of the types of information exchange requirements

 within the Weapons Coordination and Management function and to relate these

 requirements to messages, protocols, and procedures. Information

 requirements may translate into one or more data elements and may require

 more than one word or message to exchange all of the elements.

 4.11.2 WEAPONS COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT MESSAGE DESCRIPTIONS

 The Weapons Coordination and Management messages are described below. These

 messages shall be supplemented, when necessary, by messages from other

 functional areas such as PPLI, Surveillance, EW/Intelligence, and Control in

 order to provide all the necessary information to perform Weapons

 Coordination and Management.

CONTROL.

###### 4.11.2.1 COMMAND MESSAGE

 The J9.0 Command message is used by controlling units to direct other

 controlling units in weapons control activities and to transmit general alert

 conditions and weapons condition orders. Weapons control activities include

 directions to launch aircraft, return aircraft to base, transfer control of

 aircraft to another controlling unit, direct weapons systems

 engagement/disengagement for air defense, direct Air Support Operations (ASO)

 activities and direct antisubmarine warfare (ASW) operations.

 4.11.2.2 ENGAGEMENT COORDINATION MESSAGE

 The J9.1 Engagement Coordination message provides the means for two or more

 elements to coordinate engagements in order to conduct more efficient

 engagements and to reduce the probability of wasted resources.

-----

###### Engagement Coordination includes those activities between two or more weapon

 systems with common or shared defense responsibilities within an area of

 operations or theater. Weapon systems must have a means of exchanging

 options, strategies and expectations of support in order to ensure adequate

 defense of defined assets and effective use of limited resources.

 A primary example of engagement coordination is the upper tier/lower tier

 defense strategy for theater ballistic missile defense. Coordination is

 facilitated through the use of the J9.1 Engagement Coordination message. The

 J9.1 Engagement Coordination message is used to advise a lower tier/adjacent

 system that support on a particular engagement is desired; and to advise the

 requesting system that support to that engagement can or cannot be provided.

 4.11.2.3 ENGAGEMENT STATUS MESSAGE

 The J10.2 Engagement Status message provides the status of an engagement

 between the Reference TN and the Target TN. This message also provides an

 indication of the effectiveness of an engagement as well as a Heads Up

 warning to denote that the Source TN is unable to assure complete destruction

 of the target and that a threat remains. The Engagement Status message also

 provides a means of reporting a time of predicted intercept of the Target TN

 by a Friendly Weapon TN (intercept missile) from which the predicted

 intercept location may be determined. The Engagement Status message also

 provides a means of reporting the actual time of intercept for the Target TN

 from which the actual intercept location may be determined.

 4.11.2.4 HANDOVER MESSAGE

 The J10.3 Handover message provides the data necessary to perform a digital

 handover of controlled aircraft between controlling units. The data includes

 the Link 4A Address and Voice Call Sign of the controlled aircraft, and if

 the aircraft is engaged or paired, the Objective TN of the entity the

 aircraft is engaging or is paired to. The J10.3C1 Handover continuation word

 1 is used to provide data concerning the new Control Channel, Voice

 Frequency/Channel, Link 4A Frequency, IFF data, and radio information. The

 J10.3C2 Handover continuation word 2 is used to provide the controlled

 aircraft's Mission Correlator.


-----

###### 4.11.2.5 CONTROLLING UNIT REPORT MESSAGE

 The J10.5 Controlling Unit Report message is used by C[2] JUs with air control

 missions to indicate the aircraft they have under their control.

 4.11.2.6 PAIRING MESSAGE

 The J10.6 Pairing message is used to indicate the type of pairing between a

 friendly TN and the TN of another track or point. The J10.6 message is not

 used for the same purpose as the J7.2 Correlation message or the J7.7

 Association message.

 4.11.2.7 INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN J9.0, J10.2, J10.6, J12.0, AND

 J12.6 MESSAGES

 As stated in paragraph 4.11, the Weapons Coordination and Management function

 and the Control function are interactive. As such, the

 transmission/reception of a specific message, word, or data element within a

 function will cause the transmission of a specific message, word, or data

 element within the other function. Specifically the J9.0, J10.2, J10.6,

 J12.0 and J12.6 messages are dependent in such a manner as to necessitate the

 same interpretation of their interrelationship among all interfacing JUs. 

 When a system that has control capability elects to implement a specific J9.0

 Command, Tables 4.11-2, 4.11-3, 4.11-4, and 4.11-5 require that the system

 also implement for transmission the corresponding J12.0 Mission Assignment

 Discrete (MAD) and J10.2 Weapon Engagement Status (WES) or J10.6 Pairing

 Action and for reception the corresponding J12.6 Status Information Discrete

 (SID). Likewise, when a system chooses to implement a specific J12.0 MAD,

 even though it is not obligated to implement all the corresponding J9.0

 Commands, it shall implement the corresponding J10.2 WES or J10.6 Pairing

 Action, i.e., if a system chooses to implement the J9.0 Command value 15,

 Cease Proceeding to Point, it shall also implement the J12.0 MAD value 3,

 Recall, and the J10.6 Pairing Action value 15, Terminate Pairing. As the

 system is required to implement the J12.0 MAD value 3, Recall, it is not

 obligated by the tables to also implement the J9.0 Command value 17, Cease

 Conducting Procedures Indicated, or 19, Cease Duties Indicated. The tables

 establish requirements only when read from left to right. These tables do


-----

###### not imply any data forwarding requirements. The following tables specify

 this interrelationship.

 Table 4.11-2 depicts the message flow between units and can be used to

 supplement Tables 4.11-3, 4.11-4, and 4.11-5.

 Tables 4.11-3, 4.11-4, and 4.11-5 represent the relationship between J9.0

 Commands, J10.2 WESs, J12.0 MADs, and J12.6 SIDs.

 Table 4.11-3 assumes a J9.0 message is sent between C[2] JUs and the receiving
 C[2] JU transmits either manually or automatically a corresponding J12.0 message
 to the nonC[2] JU. If a nonC[2] JU transmits a J12.0 WILCO message, the J10.2

 column indicates the J10.2 WES value, or J10.6 message, if appropriate, to be
 automatically transmitted by the C[2] JU, as a result of that WILCO. This table

 is also used for J12.0 MADs that were originated without reception of a J9.0

 message.

 Table 4.11-4 is used for the remaining MADs that do not have a correlation
 with the J9.0 message, i.e., J12.0 messages that were originated by a C[2] JU

 but were not induced by reception of a J9.0 message. In this table, WES

 value 2, Weapon Assigned, is used most frequently because it is the most

 generic of the WES values. All other WES values have meanings that do not

 equate to any MAD value.

###### 4.11.3 WEAPONS COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS

 The messages described above are used in conjunction with other messages to

 coordinate and manage weapons traffic. General procedures for use of those

 messages within the various activities are discussed below. Specific

 transmit/receive rules for individual messages are included with the message

 descriptions in Section 5, Parts 1, 2, and 3.

 4.11.3.1 COMMAND PROCEDURES

 Command procedures provide for the direction of C[2] activities and the

 promulgation of weapon condition orders and general alert conditions. These

 procedures are executed as follows:

 a. Commands that are transmitted between C[2] JUs to direct C[2] JU

 activities using the J9.0I/J9.0E0 word sequence include Engage, Assign, Cease

 Engage, Salvo/Clear Aircraft, Assume Control, Engage Objective TN With Weapon

 System Specified, Break Engagement With Objective TN With Weapon System

 Specified, Proceed to Point, Cease Proceeding To Point, Conduct Procedures

 Indicated, Cease Conducting Procedures Indicated, Assume Duties Indicated,

 Cease Duties Indicated, Transfer Control, Return to Base, Launch Alert

 Aircraft, Investigate/Interrogate, Intervene, and Shadow. The J9.OC1 Command

 continuation word may only be added in two cases: firstly, with the commands

 of 21, Return to Base, and 22, Launch Alert Aircraft to provide communication

 data that may be transmitted to Friendly Weapon TN, when applicable, about

 the base to which to return or the controlling agency to receive the alert

 aircraft; secondly, with the commands 2, Engage, and 3, Assign, to

 communicate the Method of Fire. R/C is required for all command values that

 direct controlling unit activities, except as indicated below in paragraph

 4.11.3.1.3.

 b. Commands transmitted between C[2] JUs to promulgate weapon condition

 orders using the J9.0I word include Weapons Free, Weapons Tight, Hold Fire,

 Cease Fire, etc. R/C is required for all weapon condition orders, except as

 indicated below in paragraph 4.11.3.1.3.

 c. General alert conditions are transmitted between C[2] JUs via the

 J9.0I word.


-----

###### There is no provision in existing C[2] systems for automatic response to J9.0

 message commands, other than machine receipts. Systems do, however, provide

 an automatic alert to operators who shall respond by taking actions that may

 include voice communication with an airbase, ground TACS, ship, or aircraft;

 or by taking console actions that result in automatic transmission of data in

 accordance with paragraphs 4.11, 4.12 and associated subparagraphs.

 4.11.3.1.1 COMMAND AUTHORITY

 The command structure may require that one or more JUs be delegated the

 authority to transmit the J9.0 message. In this case, the JU(s) so

 designated will be identified by a Source TN which is promulgated to all IUs. 

 If the command authority is transferred between JUs, all participating JUs

 will be informed through voice communication or other communications media. 

 Nevertheless, any unit within the interface may be designated authority to

 transmit J9.0 messages without having been previously identified as a unit

 with Command Authority. Operator validation, based on the Source TN of

 received J9.0 messages, is required to verify that such orders were

 originated by an IU with the appropriate designated authority. Original J9.0

 messages shall not be automatically rejected by receiving systems on the

 basis of Source TN, to preclude automatic rejection of legal orders.

 4.11.3.1.2 REQUIRED COMMAND VALUES

 The JOC may direct command structures that require the passing of messages

 containing command, weapons status, and engagement status information between

 IUs of different Services/Agencies. Therefore, those messages must be

 capable of being exchanged between Services/Agencies in support of and in

 accordance with operational doctrine. The Command field values of the J9.0
 message which shall be implemented by all interfacing C[2] JUs and must be

 capable of inter-Service/Agency exchange are identified in Appendix A,

 Minimum Implementation.

 4.11.3.1.3 ADDRESSING OF COMMAND MESSAGES

 Original J9.0 messages (R/C field set to value 0 or 1) with the Command field

 values of Salvo/Clear Aircraft, Hold Fire, Cease Fire, Weapons Tight, Weapons

 Free, Conduct Procedures, and Cease Conducting Procedures may be addressed to


-----

###### individual JUs by using the Addressee TN field with the applicable TN set

 (R/C field set to value 0) or to all JUs by setting the Addressee TN field to

 the collective address of 00177 octal (R/C field set to value 1). Machine

 receipt J9.0 messages (R/C field set to value 2) are not transmitted in

 response to commands addressed to the collective address of 00177 octal.

 4.11.3.1.4 COMPLIANCE WITH HOLD FIRE COMMAND DEFINITION

 Receipt of the J9.0 message with the Command field set to value 5, Hold Fire,

 shall prevent launch of the missile and, upon compliance, shall cause

 transmission of a J10.2 message with the WES field set to value 8, Engagement

 Broken, if any engagement status has been reported. Because of the nature of

 certain missiles, strict compliance with the processing required by the

 definition of the J9.0 message with the Command field set to value 5, Hold

 Fire, is not possible, i.e., unable to destroy missile in flight. When the

 specific requirements of the Hold Fire cannot be met after the missile launch

 due to the nature of the weapon system, J10.2 engagement status reports shall

 continue until one of the following occurs:

 a. A manual J10.2 message with the WES field set to value 5,

 Effective/Target Destroyed/Grand Slam, report is generated.

 b. The missile is no longer capable of destroying the target, at which

 time a J10.2 message with the WES field set to value 8, Engagement Broken,

 shall be generated.

 4.11.3.1.5 USE OF COMMAND MESSAGE FOR ASO MISSIONS

 Commands may be provided to C[2] JUs controlling ASO aircraft by use of the J9.0
 message. The J9.0I/J9.0EO word sequence will be used to provide C[2] JUs with
 information necessary to order missions and assign targets to nonC[2] units
 under the control of the receiving C[2] JUs as described in the following

 paragraphs.

 a. The J9.0I word Command field values 10, Attack, and 11, Cease

 Attack, shall be utilized to direct ASO assets against specific targets. The

 Objective TN is the target to be destroyed. The Friendly Weapon TN may be

 set to the TN of the aircraft assigned the mission. The Weapon Type field in


-----

###### the J9.0I word shall be set to Aircraft. If the Friendly Weapon TN is set to
 No Statement, then the Addressee TN will assign a specific nonC[2] unit to

 accomplish the mission.

 b. Commands to C[2] JUs to conduct other ASO missions are accomplished by

 utilizing J9.0I word Command values 16, Conduct Procedures Indicated, and 17,

 Cease Conducting Procedures Indicated. The Objective TN is the target for

 the mission. The Command Mission field in the J9.0E0 shall be set to value

 27, Close Air Support, 28, Armed Reconnaissance, 29, Aerial Reconnaissance,

 or 30, Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses. Fragmentary orders may provide

 additional information and may be referenced by utilizing the J9.0E0

 Fragmentary Order Number field. To direct an Addressee TN, i.e., a
 controlling C[2] JU, to use a specific nonC[2] unit to perform a mission, the
 Friendly Weapon TN is set to the TN of the nonC[2] unit. If the Friendly Weapon
 TN is set to No Statement, then the Addressee TN will assign a specific nonC[2]

 unit to accomplish the mission.

 c. Control of nonC[2] JUs on ASO missions is accomplished in the Control

 NPG utilizing J12 series messages. Detailed protocols and procedures are

 found in Section 4.12.

 4.11.3.2 PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL OF NONC[2] UNITS

 To coordinate and manage the control of nonC[2] units, systems with nonC[2] unit
 control missions shall have the capability to indicate which nonC[2] units they
 have under their control and to effect transfer of nonC[2] unit control between
 controlling units. Controlling units are those C[2] JUs capable of performing
 nonC[2] unit control functions, such as positive control, flight following,

 radar advisory, etc. Procedures for assumption of control, termination of

 control, and handover of control are discussed below.

 4.11.3.2.1 ASSUMPTION OF CONTROL

 When a controlling unit has completed voice or digital communications as
 described in paragraph 4.12.1.3.7, assuring that both the nonC[2] unit and the
 controlling unit understand that the nonC[2] unit is under its control, the

 controlling unit initiates transmission of a series of J10.5 messages. A

 controlling unit shall transmit a J10.5 message for each unit under its


-----

###### control. Reporting of controlling unit status on the same nonC[2] unit by more
 than one C[2] JU shall cause operator alerts at the conflicting units. R[2] for
 surveillance data on a controlled nonC[2] unit is determined as for any other

 track.

 4.11.3.2.2 HANDOVER OF CONTROL

 The Link 16 digital handover of controlled nonC[2] units is performed as

 described in this paragraph. Procedures for the handover of a remotely

 piloted vehicle (RPV)/missile are TBD. The following procedures address

 Request For Assume Control, Request for Transfer Control, and Handover
 Resulting from a Command Message. Controlling C[2] JU A is the original
 controlling C[2] JU and controlling C[2] JU B is the new controlling C[2] JU.

 a. Request for Assume Control. C[2] JU A requests C[2] JU B to assume
 control of a nonC[2] unit by transmitting an original J10.3I/J10.3E0 word

 sequence with the R/C field set to value 0. The J10.3E0 word provides the
 following nonC[2] unit information as appropriate: Voice Call Sign, the

 Objective TN to which it is assigned/engaged, and its Link 4A Address. The

 Request for Assume Control field in the J10.3 message shall be set to value 0

 or 1. The Request for Assume Control field set to value 1 shall be used only
 when transferring control of a nonC[2] unit that is engaging, i.e., C[2] JU A is

 transmitting J10.2 messages with the WES field set to values 2-7 or 11-14 on
 the nonC[2] unit that is the subject of the handover. The nonC[2] unit may be

 engaged to one or more targets although only one target can be reported in
 the J10.3E0 word Objective TN field. Therefore, C[2] JU B should alert the
 operator to all J10.2 engagements currently held for the nonC[2] unit when the

 original J10.3 message is received. The Request for Assume Control field
 shall be set to value 0 when used to handover nonC[2] units that are not

 engaging. A J10.3C2 word may be added to transmit the Mission Correlator
 assigned to the nonC[2] unit. C[2] JU B transmits a machine receipt J10.3 message

 with the R/C field set to value 2. Upon receipt of the handover request, the
 operator in C[2] JU B will be alerted. The operator then performs console

 action(s) that cause transmission of a WILCO or a CANTCO J10.3 message with

 the R/C field set to value 3 or 6. The J10.3 message with the R/C field set

 to value 3, WILCO, shall be a J10.3I/J10.3E0/J10.3C1 word sequence with the
 information that C[2] JU A must provide to the nonC[2] JU in a J12.4 Controlling

 Unit Change message to assist in performing the handover.


-----

###### C[2] JU A transmits a machine receipt J10.3 message with the R/C field set to
 value 2 to C[2] JU B in response to the C[2] JU B J10.3 message with the R/C field
 set to value 3, WILCO. If the nonC[2] unit is an active JU, the change of

 control is executed using J12.4 messages as described in paragraph

 4.12.1.3.7b. Upon receipt of a J12.4 message with the R/C field set to value
 3, WILCO, from the nonC[2] JU, C[2] JU A shall transmit a J10.5 Controlling Unit

 Report with the Controlling Unit Status and the Handover Indicator fields set

 to value 1 and shall cease reporting any J10.2 Engagement Status or J10.6
 Pairing messages for the nonC[2] JU. After completion of the change of control
 in accordance with paragraph 4.12.1.3.7b, C[2] JU B shall indicate the

 completion of the handover by transmitting the J10.5 message and may begin
 transmission of the J12.X messages to the nonC[2] JU. C[2] JU A shall cease

 transmitting the J10.5 Controlling Unit Report message upon receipt of a
 J10.5 message from C[2] JU B. C[2] JU B shall transmit any J10.2 or J10.6
 messages if C[2] JU A was reporting any engagements or pairings for the nonC[2]

 JU.

 If for any reason the nonC[2] JU is unable to complete the handover with C[2] JU B
 in accordance with paragraph 4.12.1.3.7b, the nonC[2] JU may request control by
 C[2] JU A. If C[2] JU A assumes control again, it shall send a Cancel Handover
 Request to C[2] JU B and set the Handover Indicator field to value 0 in the

 J10.5 messages.

 When the Request for Assume Control field is set to value 0 or 1, the J10.3C1
 word shall be originated by C[2] JU B in its J10.3 message with the R/C field

 set to value 3, WILCO, response. The data in this J10.3C1 word shall provide
 information specified by C[2] JU B for control. As a minimum, it shall provide
 the Control Channel or Link 4A Frequency on which C[2] JU B desires to exercise

 control, unless control is to be performed by voice only. It may also

 provide the UHF Frequency or Channel Group A or B to be used for voice

 coordination (or control if both Control Channel and Link 4A Frequency fields

 are set to No Statement), secure radio information (Radio Type (UHF-AM or

 UHF-FM) and Secure Radio Indicator) about the UHF Frequency, the Mode III
 Code C[2] JU B desires the nonC[2] JU to use, or a request for the nonC[2] JU to

 Squawk Flash.

 b. Request for Transfer Control. C[2] JU B may request control by
 transmitting the J10.3I/J10.3E0/J10.3C1 word sequence to C[2] JU A. The Request


-----

###### for Assume Control field in the J10.3 message shall be set to value 2. All
 of the communications information in the J10.3E0 and J10.3C1 words apply to C[2]
 JU B. If available, the C[2] JU B Voice Call Sign shall be provided. The Link

 4A Address shall be provided if Link 4A control is desired. As a minimum,

 the J10.3C1 word shall contain the Control Channel or Link 4A Frequency on
 which C[2] JU B desires to exercise control, unless control is to be performed

 by voice only. It may also provide the UHF Frequency or Channel Group A or B

 to be used for voice coordination (or control if both Control Channel and

 Link 4A Frequency fields are set to No Statement), secure radio information

 (Radio Type (UHF-AM or UHF-FM) and Secure Radio Indicator) about the UHF
 Frequency, the Mode III Code C[2] JU B desires the nonC[2] unit to use, or a
 request for the nonC[2] unit to Squawk Flash.

 The J10.3C1 word is included in the original J10.3 message with the Request

 for Assume Control field set to value 2 and the R/C field set to value 0, and
 C[2] JU A is not allowed to alter any of the data in its WILCO reply. If C[2] JU

 A does not agree with any of the J10.3C1 data, its only options are voice

 communications prior to transmitting a WILCO, or transmitting a J10.3 message

 with the R/C field set to value 6, CANTCO. When the J10.3 message with the
 R/C field set to value 6 is transmitted, C[2] JU A maintains control.

 c. Handover Resulting from a Command Message. Handovers may occur as

 a result of orders received in the J9.0 message. After receipt of an order,

 the receiving unit shall initiate the appropriate Request for Assume Control

 sequence as described in paragraphs a and b.

 d. Specific protocols for implementing the J10.3 messages to

 accomplish the handover functions are contained in the following paragraphs:

 (1) Platform and System Status Information. C[2] JU B may or may

 not have platform and system status information on the Reference TN. If not,
 C[2] JU B may request this information by transmitting the J7.1 Data Update
 Request message to C[2] JU A prior to transmitting a J10.3 message with the R/C

 field set to value 3, WILCO.

 (2) Cancellation of a Handover. A C[2] JU may cancel a handover by

 transmitting a J10.3 message with the Cancellation Indicator field set to


-----

###### value 1 anytime prior to reception of a Controlling Unit Report from the
 other C[2] JU in accordance with the following:

 (a) Cancel Handover Request. C[2] JU A initiation of a J10.3

 message to cancel a Handover Request shall inhibit transmission of the J12.4
 message if it has not already occurred, and the handover is terminated. If C[2]

 JU A desires to regain control after receiving a Controlling Unit Report from
 C[2] JU B, it shall initiate a Request for Transfer of Control as described in

 paragraph b above.

 (b) Cancel Request for Transfer of Control. C[2] JU B

 initiation of a J10.3 message to cancel a Request for Transfer of Control
 shall inhibit transmission of the J12.4 message from C[2] JU A if it has not

 occurred already and the handover is terminated. If the J12.4 message has
 been transmitted, C[2] JU A shall transmit a J10.3 CANTPRO message and C[2] JU B

 shall complete the transfer of control. If after transmitting the
 Controlling Unit Report C[2] JU B desires C[2] JU A to take control, C[2] JU B shall
 initiate a Handover Request to C[2] JU A.

 In either of the cases above, if the nonC[2] JU is unable to contact C[2] JU B and
 returns to C[2] JU A, C[2] JU A shall transmit a J10.3 message with the

 Cancellation Indicator field set to value 1.

 A J10.3 message transmitted to cancel a handover or transfer of control shall

 be a copy of the original request except that the Cancellation Indicator

 field shall be set to value 1 and the Addressee TN shall be set

 appropriately.

 (3) Failure to Acknowledge. When a J10.3 original message has

 not been acknowledged in accordance with the transmit/receive rules, the host

 system shall alert the operator. The receipt of a WILCO, CANTCO, or CANTPRO

 response to an original message shall inhibit setting the alert for no

 acknowledgement. If a CANTCO or CANTPRO response message is received, the

 handover process via data link terminates and voice coordination may be

 required.

 (4) Assumption of Control. C[2] JU B shall transmit the J10.5
 message in accordance with paragraph 4.11.3.2.1. If the nonC[2] unit is


-----

###### engaged/paired, C[2] JU B must initially transmit the locally held engagement

 status/pairing values on the engagements/pairings previously reported. 

 Acceptance of an engaged/paired handover constitutes the acceptance of the

 engagements/pairings. (See paragraphs 4.11.3.3.1 and 4.11.3.3.3.)

 (5) Duplicate Reporting of Control. Units receiving a J10.5

 message from a Source TN different from that previously received shall accept
 the latest Source TN as the controlling C[2] JU.

 4.11.3.2.3 TERMINATION OF CONTROL

 When a controlling C[2] JU terminates control of a track or is going to drop a

 track from its local database which it has previously been reporting as a

 controlled track, a J10.5 message indicating termination of control shall be
 transmitted. If the controlled track is a JU, the controlling C[2] JU shall
 send a J12.4 message to the nonC[2] JU indicating termination of control. A

 J10.2 Engagement Broken message or a J10.6 Terminate Pairing message shall be

 sent only when an engagement is broken or the pairing is terminated. These

 messages are not transmitted solely as the result of terminating control of a

 track. Transmission of the J10.5 message and the J12.4 message, when

 appropriate, with the Controlling Unit Status field set to the terminating

 control value, completes the terminate control procedure. The J10.5
 Terminate Control message is not to be used during a handover among C[2] JUs. 
 For handover procedures between C[2] JUs, refer to paragraph 4.11.3.2.2. When
 performing a handover from a C[2] JU to a nonIU, the J10.5 Terminate Control
 message shall be transmitted by the C[2] JU.

 4.11.3.3 REPORTING OF STATUS

 All JUs shall report their own platform and system status. Controlling units

 shall report the platform and system status of units under their control that

 are not reporting their own status. If conflicting data are received at

 approximately the same time, data received from the platform shall take
 precedence. C[2] JUs shall have the capability to report the status of

 engagements conducted by own JU, by units under their control, and by nonIUs
 not under control. C[2] JUs also report pairings. Engagement status, platform

 and system status, and pairing status reporting procedures are described in

 the following subparagraphs.


-----

###### 4.11.3.3.1 REPORTING OF ENGAGEMENT STATUS

 The reporting of engagement status for controlled units and other than

 controlled units is as follows:

 a. Engagement Status for Controlled Units. The reporting of

 engagement status for controlled units is as follows:

 (1) Only the controlling C[2] JU shall report the engagement status

 of a controlled unit in the J10.2 message. To report engagement status, a
 controlling C[2] JU must have the Reference TN under control. Engagement status
 shall be reported by the controlling C[2] JU in the following situations:

 (a) Upon initiating or changing the engagement status of

 the Reference TN, but only after confirmation is received from the Reference

 TN. Confirmation is receipt of a J12.0 WILCO message, a J12.6 message as

 described in (f) below, a voice acknowledgement, or an operator observation. 

 In the case of one-way communication, transmission of the order is considered

 confirmation.

 (b) Upon accepting the handover of an engaging platform.

 (c) Periodically, in accordance with the transmit/receive

 rules.

 (d) In response to a J7.1 message containing either the

 Reference TN or Target TN.

 (e) In response to a J7.1 message with the Weapon Status

 Data Request Indicator field set to value 1.

 (f) Upon receipt of an initial J12.6 message with the SID
 field set to value 1, 2, 3, 6, or 7 from an engaging nonC[2] JU or a J12.6

 message changing a previously reported engagement status.

 (2) Engagements shall be terminated by transmitting a J10.2

 message with the WES field set to value 5, Target Destroyed, or 8, Engagement

 Broken. If value 5, Target Destroyed, is used, the message shall be


-----

###### transmitted in accordance with Table J10.2 until sensor contact is

 cancelled/lost.

 (3) The controlling C[2] JU shall transmit a J10.2 message with the

 WES field set to value 5, Target Destroyed, or 8, Engagement Broken, to break
 an engagement when the engagement which that C[2] JU has been reporting is

 terminated.

 b. Engagement Status for other than Controlled Units. In addition to

 the controlling unit reporting engagement status of controlled units as
 specified in paragraph 4.11.3.3.1a, all C[2] JUs that have a weapon capability

 shall have the capability to report their own engagement status in the J10.2
 message. Further, all C[2] JUs may report the status of engagements conducted

 by nonIUs in the J10.2 message. Rules for reporting engagement status of

 other than controlled units are as follows:

 (1) The Reference TN is the unit actually conducting the

 engagement. The Reference TN shall be set identical to Source TN for reports

 of engagements conducted by own JU.

 (2) Other than the setting of the Reference TN, there is no

 difference between the capability and procedures required for the reporting

 of engagements conducted by own JU and those conducted by nonIUs that are not

 controlled units. The JU initially transmitting nonIU engagement status

 shall retain Engagement Status report responsibility until the nonIU

 engagement is terminated.

 (3) The C[2] JU initiating engagement status reporting on a Target

 TN shall retain the responsibility for reporting the status until the

 engagement is terminated. The reporting of all engagements must be

 terminated. Termination consists of transmitting a J10.2 message with the

 WES field set to value 5, Target Destroyed or 8, Engagement Broken.

 4.11.3.3.2 REPORTING OF PLATFORM AND SYSTEM STATUS

 Individual unit platform and system status must be available to all C[2] JUs in

 the interface. JUs will use the appropriate J13 Platform and System Status

 message to report current status including stores, fuel, operational status,


-----

###### host system's status, etc. The Voice Group A and B Channels reported in

 Platform and System Status messages shall be the channels on which the
 Reference TN is operating. C[2] JUs, weapons systems JUs, and support platform

 JUs shall report their own platform and system status and, under certain
 conditions described below, controlling C[2] JUs shall report the platform and

 system status of platforms under their control.

 a. All JUs shall report their own platform and system status initially

 when entering the network, upon significant change of status, periodically in
 accordance with the transmit/receive rules, and for C[2] JUs in response to a

 J7.1 message. Platform and System Status messages shall be transmitted on

 the PPLI and Status Group B NPGs in accordance with paragraph 4.2.3.10.4.

 b. The controlling C[2] JU shall report platform and system status on

 units under their control that do not report their own platform and system

 status. This will be done initially upon taking control, periodically in

 accordance with the transmit/receive rules, and in accordance with paragraph

 4.2.3.10.4.

 c. A C[2] JU that requires platform and system status on a controlled air
 track shall request the information from the C[2] JU controlling the platform,

 as indicated in the J10.5 message, by transmitting a J7.1 message with the

 Data Update Request Action field set to value 1, Data Update Request by TN. 
 The controlling C[2] JU shall transmit the appropriate J13 message.

 d. A C[2] JU that requires Platform and System Status on a C[2] JU shall
 request the information from the C[2] JU by transmitting a J7.1 Data Update
 Request by TN message containing the C[2] JU's TN as Reference TN.

 e. C[2] JUs shall report platform and system status on units under their

 control when the controlled unit is in a Conditional Radio Silence mode. 
 Also, when the controlling C[2] JU has not received a J13 message from the
 controlled unit for two update periods, the controlling C[2] JU shall begin

 transmitting periodic Platform and System Status messages on the controlled

 unit. When the controlled unit resumes transmission of Platform and System
 Status messages, the controlling C[2] JU shall cease its reporting.


-----

###### f. Conflicting data may be received from different units reporting the

 status on a given platform. The acceptance priority is JU platforms' own
 status, then C[2] JUs exercising control over JU platforms.

 g. The Voice Group A and B Channels reported in Platform and System

 Status messages shall be the channels on which the Reference TN is operating.

 h. The J13.2C2 and J13.2C7 Type of Stores and Number of Stores fields

 shall be interpreted as follows:

 (1) If the Type of Stores field is set to a value other than 0,

 No Statement, and the Number of Stores field is set to a value other than 63,

 No Statement, the aircraft's current specific onboard inventory (0 to 62

 units) of that Type of Stores is reported.

 (2) If Type of Stores is other than No Statement and Number of

 Stores is No Statement, that Type of Stores is currently carried by the

 aircraft but no data are being reported about the number of that Type of

 Stores.

 (3) If Type of Stores is No Statement and Number of Stores is

 other than No Statement, the specific onboard inventory of an unspecified

 type of weapon is reported.

 (4) If Type of Stores and Number of Stores are both No

 Statement, no data are reported.

 4.11.3.3.3 C[2] JUS REPORTING OF PAIRING STATUS

 C[2] JUs shall use the J10.6 message to indicate a pairing between a friendly

 track and another track or point. Pairing values shall not be used to pair a

 point or track for the purpose of indicating an engagement status. A pairing

 to a point must have been preceded by a J3 Surveillance message with the

 Point Amplification field set to a valid value. A JU that has been reporting

 a pairing on a track that is the subject of a completed handover shall cease

 transmitting the J10.6 message and shall not transmit a J10.6 message

 terminating the pairing on that track (see paragraph 4.11.3.2.2a). If the
 controlling C[2] JU reporting pairings becomes inactive, then all pairings


-----

###### previously reported by that controlling C[2] JU are purged. If one of the

 paired TNs is dropped, the pairing is purged.

 4.11.3.4 ENGAGEMENT COORDINATION PROCEDURES

 When operating in a theater with shared defense responsibilities, systems may

 find it operationally effective and efficient to coordinate their engagements

 against common threats. The J9.1 Engagement Coordination message provides a

 means for two or more JUs to coordinate engagements in near real-time via

 Link 16. Engagement coordination is a cooperative relationship that does

 not, in and of itself, empower any participant JU with command authority, as

 defined in paragraph 4.11.3.1.1.

 When two or more JUs operate in a cooperative defense posture, they may share

 engagement intent, method of fire (MOF), probability of kill (PK), tracking

 status, and support expectations via the J9.1 Engagement Coordination

 message. If the coordinating systems have common defended assets, the

 assets, and the priority to be given to each asset, may be reported to each

 system via the J3.0 Reference Point message. Participating JUs are

 responsible for developing specific coordination procedures, but they shall

 adhere to the following general guidelines.

 a. The normal message exchange sequence begins with a JU's detection,

 or receipt of a potentially threatening track. The JU shall evaluate the

 nature of the threat to determine if:

 (1) the threat will be engaged,

 (2) the threat is eligible for coordinated engagement, and

 (3) support is needed.

 Criteria for coordinated engagements shall be predetermined by the

 participating JUs. The JU will initiate the engagement coordination process

 by transmitting a J9.1 Engagement Coordination message with its engagement

 intent and/or support expectations.


-----

###### b. Each threat shall be treated as a separate engagement coordination

 process.

 c. The Engagement Coordination Action Value (ECAV) in the J9.1I word

 shall be used by a JU to indicate its engagement intentions, availability to

 provide support, or support expectations to other JUs participating in the

 engagement coordination activity.

 (1) ECAV = 0, Intend to Engage, or ECAV = 1, Do Not Intend to

 Engage, is transmitted by a JU to announce its engagement intention against a

 target. No expectation of support is implied.

 (2) ECAV = 2, Available for Support, or ECAV = 3, Not Available

 for Support, is transmitted by a JU as a response to the receipt of a J9.1

 Engagement Coordination message with ECAV = 4, Support Expected. In

 addition, a JU may transmit a J9.1 Engagement Coordination message with ECAV

 = 2, Available for Support, or ECAV = 3, Not Available for Support, at any

 time to report its availability to support another JU.

 (3) ECAV = 4, Support Expected, or ECAV = 5, Support Not

 Expected, is used when a JU intends to engage the threat. That is, JUs

 receiving these ECAVs may assume that the JU transmitting the message intends

 to engage the threat, and that the MOF is based on the expectation of support

 as indicated in the ECAV field.

 d. A J9.1 Engagement Coordination message with ECAV = 0, Intend to

 Engage, ECAV = 4, Support Expected, or ECAV = 5, Support Not Expected,

 indicates an intention to engage and does not supplant the requirement to

 transmit the appropriate J10.2 Engagement Status message.

 e. If a JU's availability changes after responding to a J9.1

 Engagement Coordination message, the JU updates its availability status by

 transmitting another J9.1 Engagement Coordination message addressed to the JU

 that initiated the engagement coordination process.

 f. A JU's MOF, as reported in the J9.1 Engagement Coordination

 message, reflects the JU's planned MOF against the referenced target.


-----

###### g. The PK, as reported in the J9.1 Engagement Coordination message, is

 the predicted PK of the sending unit against the referenced target, based on

 the selected MOF. It does not reflect the combined PK of the participating

 JUs.

 h. The Tracking Status field of the J9.1 Engagement Coordination

 message is used to indicate the reporting JU's tracking status even when that
 JU does not hold R[2] for the referenced track. It is not dependent on the

 engagement intent of the reporting JU and is not transmitted in lieu of a

 J10.2 Engagement Status message.

 4.11.3.5 THEATER BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE PROCEDURES

 Theater Missile Defense (TMD) is defined as all measures taken to defeat,

 destroy, or neutralize enemy theater missiles employed against friendly

 forces and assets. The term theater missile (TM) applies to ballistic

 missiles, cruise missiles (CM), and tactical air-to-surface missiles (TASM)

 whose targets are within a given theater of operation. A ballistic missile

 is any missile which does not rely upon aerodynamic surfaces to produce lift

 and consequently follows a ballistic trajectory when thrust is terminated

 (JCS Pub 1-02).

 The active portion of the TMD provides protection against theater ballistic

 missiles (TBM), CMs and TASMs, by destroying them in flight. Theater

 Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD) is concerned with the active defense against

 the TBM portion of the total TM threat.

 TBMD capable systems may be comprised of lower tier and upper tier missile

 defenses which provide critical asset and area defense. The TBMD systems may

 operate independently or as an integrated, multi-tiered system, or in

 geographically distributed enclaves. Lower tier systems will provide TBMD
 for designated critical assets, e.g., airfields, theater C[2] nodes, or seats of

 government as well as protecting theater targets, naval and maneuver forces,

 supply points, or critical weapon delivery systems. When integrated with

 area defense elements, lower tier systems will have the capability to operate

 collectively or independently primarily against short-range ballistic

 missiles as well as other tactical missiles (CMs and TASMs). Upper tier TBMD

 systems provide broad coverage, area defense against TBMs. Area defense


-----

###### systems engage ballistic missiles at high altitude as early in their course

 as possible helping to negate the primary and secondary effects of mass

 destruction weapons, and provide for an overall larger defended area. When

 integrated with lower tier systems, area defense systems are capable of

 independent or cooperative operation to increase the overall defense

 effectiveness. The primary focus of upper tier systems is the medium-range

 ballistic missile.

 4.11.3.6 ELECTRONIC WARFARE COORDINATION PROCEDURES

 EW actions are divided into three types of EW, i.e., ES, EA, and EP. The ES

 and EA control and coordination procedures are limited to those JUs that

 perform ES and EA. This does not preclude a unit not possessing organic

 ES/EA capabilities from controlling and coordinating these actions. The

 specific protocols and procedures are contained in paragraph 4.5 of this

 document. Further, the EP activities of these EW participants are also

 contained in paragraph 4.5.

 The EW C[2] JUs participating on the Surveillance Net PG will follow all of the

 protocols specified in paragraphs 4.4 and 4.7 of this document.

 4.11.3.6.1 ELECTRONIC PROTECTION COORDINATION PROCEDURES WITH NONC[2] JUS

 The EP activities of nonC[2] JUs are generally preplanned when they are in
 support of C[2] JUs. Therefore, coordination of these activities is not

 required here.

 Cases also exist where nonC[2] JUs must initiate EP activities in a self

 defensive role. These cases will not require any coordination procedures on

 the Link 16 interface.

 Cases which may require Link 16 support in the conduct of nonC[2] JU EP

 activities are TBD, but will likely be disseminated by communications media

 other than JTIDS/MIDS.


-----

###### 4.12 CONTROL

 Control is the near real-time direction of weapons systems and supporting

 platforms for the accomplishment of assigned missions. The Control function
 provides the exchange of information between C[2] JUs and weapon systems/

 platforms to accomplish Aircraft Control, Surface (Maritime) Control (TBD),

 Subsurface (Maritime) Control (TBD), Land (Ground) Control (TBD), and EW

 Control.

 From a controlling C[2] JU's point of view, missile systems are utilized in the

 same manner as aircraft weapons delivery systems. Obviously, missile systems

 have limitations that preclude the use of some of the J12 control series

 messages. However, in the areas of mission assignment, target track

 correlation, and target sorting, these missile systems are to be viewed
 exactly as fighter aircraft. Therefore, whenever a nonC[2] JU appears in the

 discussion of these areas, it shall be construed to mean both aircraft and

 missile systems of this type.

 4.12.1 AIRCRAFT CONTROL

 Aircraft Control is the direction of air units by controlling units. 

 Aircraft Control using Link 16 messages provides the information necessary to

 direct actions such as air intercepts, vectoring support aircraft, search and

 rescue (SAR) operations, air traffic control (ATC), controlling remotely

 piloted vehicles (RPVs), controlling missiles, instrument landings, precision

 bombing, the aviation portion of ASW, EW support, and final control of CAS

 missions. Aircraft Control interacts with the Mission Management function

 and Weapons Coordination and Management function and is supported by the

 Surveillance function, EW/Intelligence function, Information Management

 function and PPLI function.

 Controlling C[2] JUs will participate in continuous two-way Link 16 data
 communications with assigned nonC[2] JUs. Sensor target information derived
 locally by nonC[2] JUs will be made available to the Link 16 network by the
 controlling C[2] JU, given the constraints of the tactical situation and sensor
 target reporting is on. The default for sensor target reporting by nonC[2] JUs
 to C[2] JUs on the Control NPG is on. For nonC[2] JUs not implementing MADs 37
 and 38 default is off. Canceling sensor target reporting by nonC[2] JUs to C[2]


-----

###### JUs on the Control NPG is initiated by the J12.0 (MAD = 38, Sensor Target

 Reports Off) Mission Assignment message. Situational awareness is provided

 primarily through J3 Surveillance series, J7 Information Management series,

 and J10.2 Engagement Status messages. Minimum implementation of messages for

 Air Control information exchange is provided in Appendix A.

 4.12.1.1 AIRCRAFT CONTROL INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS

 The information exchange requirements for support of mission phases of

 Aircraft Control are contained within the J12 Control series and J13 Platform

 and System Status series messages.

 4.12.1.2 NONCOMMAND AND CONTROL JTIDS/MIDS UNIT CONTROL MESSAGE

 DESCRIPTIONS

 NonC[2] JU Control messages are described below.

 4.12.1.2.1 MISSION ASSIGNMENT MESSAGE

 The J12.0 Mission Assignment message is transmitted to assign missions,

 designate targets, and provide other information. The J12.0I Mission

 Assignment initial word provides the Mission Assignment discrete and threat

 warning environment information. The J12.0C1 Target Position continuation

 word provides position, Index Number, and Strength of the target. The

 J12.0C2 Target Data continuation word provides additional target information

 such as Course, Speed, Altitude, and Specific Type. See paragraph

 4.12.1.3.17 for the use of the Exercise Indicator in the J12.0C2 continuation

 word. The J12.0C3 Point Location continuation word provides the point's

 position, type, number and elevation. The J12.0C4 Surface Attack

 continuation word provides Target Types, Target Defenses, Run-in/Egress

 Headings, and stores delivery information. The J12.0C5 Bombing continuation

 word provides the information necessary to perform beacon bombing. The

 J12.0C6 Targeting continuation word provides the information necessary for

 laser targeting or the Related 3 TN or Related IN. The J12.0C7 Third Party

 continuation word provides information for third party mission assignments

 and elevation angle of the target.


-----

###### 4.12.1.2.2 VECTOR MESSAGE

 The J12.1 Vector message is used by controlling C[2] JUs to transmit course,

 speed, and altitude information for aircraft control activities such as ATC,

 air intercept control (AIC), and navigational assistance. The J12.1E0 Vector

 extension word provides Time-to-Intercept and R/C information.

 4.12.1.2.3 PRECISION AIRCRAFT DIRECTION MESSAGE

 The J12.2 Precision Aircraft Direction (PAD) message is used by controlling C[2]

 JUs for operations requiring precise control positioning of mission aircraft,

 e.g., ground-directed release of ordnance, automatic carrier landing

 operations, ground-directed air cargo delivery, and RPV operations. The

 J12.2I initial word provides the Addressee TN with vertical and lateral

 flight path corrections, a Drop Discrete for stores delivery, and an

 Autopilot Control Bit.

 4.12.1.2.4 FLIGHT PATH MESSAGE

 The J12.3 Flight Path message is used by controlling C[2] JUs to provide air

 units with multiple-leg flight path information. The J12.3I Flight Path

 initial word provides the Addressee TN with the Sequence Numbers of the

 waypoints and the time associated with the waypoint. The J12.3E0 Flight Path

 extension word provides the three-axis geographic position of each

 transmitted point.

 4.12.1.2.5 CONTROLLING UNIT CHANGE MESSAGE

 The J12.4 Controlling Unit Change message is used to provide information

 necessary to initiate control, handover control, or terminate control of a
 nonC[2] JU by a C[2] JU. Control may be initiated by either a C[2] JU or a nonC[2] JU. 

 Procedures for all uses of the J12.4 message are provided in paragraph

 4.12.1.3.7.

 4.12.1.2.6 TARGET/TRACK CORRELATION MESSAGE

 The J12.5 Target/Track Correlation message is used by controlling C[2] JUs to

 report the correlation/ decorrelation of an index number(s) of a target


-----

###### report(s) to a specified TN of a surveillance track. Multiple correlations

 and decorrelations may be reported by use of the J12.5E0/J12.5E1 Target/Track

 Correlation extension words. The J12.5I Target/Track Correlation initial

 word provides the Objective TN, Index Originator TN, Index Number assigned by

 originator, Correlation Indicator, Evaluated Strength, Evaluated Identity,

 and ID/Strength Indicator. The J12.5E0/J12.5E1 word(s) indicate additional

 correlations and decorrelations to the same surveillance track by providing

 six additional sets of Index Originator TNs, Index Numbers, and Correlation

 Indicators uniquely identified by the letters B through G to allow multiple

 correlations/decorrelations between Index Numbers and Index Originator TNs to
 the Objective TN in the J12.5I word. The J12.5 message shall be used by C[2]

 JUs to report the correlation/decorrelation of air, land (ground), and

 surface (maritime) targets. In the event that multiple targets (specified by

 IN/Index Originator TN combination) are correlated to the same track

 (Objective TN), it shall not be implied that a given target is correlated to

 the other targets listed.

 4.12.1.2.7 TARGET SORTING MESSAGE

 JUs shall use the J12.6 Target Sorting message to accomplish the following

 tasks:

 a. Enable nonC[2] JUs to exchange targets and targeting information among

 themselves.

 b. Pass sensor data to C[2] JUs and among nonC[2] JUs.

 c. Pass nonC[2] JU engagement status information between nonC[2] JUs and
 from nonC[2] JUs to controlling C[2] JUs.

 d. Control among nonC[2] JUs.

 NonC[2] JUs originating J12.6 messages will report locally derived data or data

 derived from data fusion from offboard sources. If any of the fields, except

 Objective TN, contain data derived from offboard sources, this fact shall be

 reported in the Fusion Type field. If the Objective TN has been provided in

 a J12.5 or J12.0 message, the Correlation Indicator field shall be set to
 value 0. If the Objective TN is established from nonC[2] onboard correlation


-----

###### processing, the Correlation Indicator field shall be set to value 1 . The

 Identity field in the J12.6E0 word shall be changed by operator action only

 and the default value is 0, Pending.

 The J12.6I and J12.6E0 Target Sorting initial and extension words contain

 basic information on the target and the Status Information Discrete (SID). 

 The J12.6C1 Engagement Status continuation word contains information

 necessary for addressing and amplification of target data, as well as the

 capability to set a pointer. The J12.6C2 Fusion Type continuation word is

 used to provide Sensor and Fusion Type information about the Objective TN or

 Third Party Index Number and time tag information for the target data. The

 Time Indicator field in the J12.6C2 word describes how to interpret the

 Minute, Second, and Hundredths fields. If the Time Indicator field is set to

 Time of Observation, the Minute, Second, and Hundredths fields represent the

 time at which the target data was measured. If the Time Indicator field is

 set to Track Age, the Minute, Second, and Hundredths fields represent the

 time since the target data was last extrapolated. If the Time Indicator

 field is set to Time of Extrapolation, the Minute, Second, and Hundredths

 fields represent the time to which the host platform has extrapolated the

 target data. Time of Extrapolation does not imply that the platform has lost

 contact with the target and is "coasting" the target data. The J12.6C3

 Kinematic Quality continuation word provides uncertainty information for

 radar targets, targets that are being derived from sensors other than radar,

 or in the case of aircraft with Multiple Source Integration (MSI)

 capabilities, target data derived from multiple onboard sensors. The J12.6C4

 Identity/Specific Type Ambiguity continuation word is used to support ID

 exchange for aircraft with automatic ID correlation techniques. The J12.6C5

 Future Event and the J12.6C6 Sensor Management continuation words are used to

 provide for rapid update of onboard system parameters among sophisticated
 nonC[2] JU weapon platforms. Target transmit sequences for nonC[2] JUs who

 implement various J12.6 words are provided in the J12.6 T/R rules.

 C[2] JUs may also use the J12.6 Target Sorting message to report updated
 positional or engagement status data to nonC[2] JUs. In this case, the message

 is addressed collectively.


-----

###### 4.12.1.2.8 TARGET BEARING MESSAGE

 The J12.7 Target Bearing message provides JUs the capability to pass sensor

 target information which has been derived from sensors that provide a line
 of-sight to the target. Index Numbers are used to report targets in the same

 manner as in the J12.6 message, from a common pool. When reporting targets

 derived in this manner, e.g., IR, ES, TV, the reporting JU must establish the

 target using the J12.7I, J12.7E0, and J12.7E1 words. Origin of angles,

 angles to the target, and time associated with the target data shall be

 included as a minimum. If a range estimate for the target is available, then

 the J12.7C1 word may be transmitted. The J12.7C2 word is used when the

 identity of the target can be obtained by sensor sources. Angle rates may be

 transmitted in the J12.7E1 word. Range Rate may be transmitted in the

 J12.7C1 word. Angle rates and Range Rate contain both observer and target

 motion along the appropriate axis. Observer rates may be transmitted in the

 J12.7C1 and J12.7C3 words.

 4.12.1.2.9 AIR PLATFORM AND SYSTEM STATUS MESSAGE

 The J13.2 Air Platform and System Status message provides the current status

 of an air platform to include fuel, ordnance status, operational status and

 on-board systems' status.

 4.12.1.2.10 SURFACE (MARITIME) PLATFORM AND SYSTEM STATUS MESSAGE

 The J13.3 Surface (Maritime) Platform and System Status message provides the

 current status of a surface (maritime) platform to include ordnance load,

 operational status, and on-board systems' status.

 4.12.1.2.11 THE SUBSURFACE (MARITIME) PLATFORM AND SYSTEM STATUS

 MESSAGE

 The J13.4 Subsurface (Maritime) Platform and System Status message provides

 the current status of a subsurface (maritime) platform to include operational

 status and on-board systems' status.


-----

###### 4.12.1.2.12 LAND (GROUND) PLATFORM AND SYSTEM STATUS MESSAGE

 The J13.5 Land (Ground) Platform and System Status message provides the

 current operational weapons and equipment status of a land (ground) platform.

 4.12.1.3 AIRCRAFT CONTROL PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS

 The procedures and protocols provided for within Aircraft Control are

 described below.

 4.12.1.3.1 MISSION ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES

 Mission assignment procedures are described in the following paragraphs:

 a. Mission Assignments. Definitions of specific words and mission

 assignment word sequences are specified in the J12 series transmit/receive

 rules found in section 5, part 2. The J12.0 Mission Assignment message shall

 include sufficient information to establish a track file.

 Upon receipt of a J12.0 with the Objective TN set to other than No Statement,
 the nonC[2] JU will break all local filters on that Objective TN. The nonC[2] JU

 will not respond with a J12.0 message with the R/C field set to value 16,

 CANTPRO (Objective TN Not Held), until local filters have been broken for 30

 seconds (60 seconds for LOB targets). Target report index numbers are

 correlated/decorrelated to the surveillance track TNs with the J12.5

 Target/Track Correlation message as explained in paragraph 4.12.1.2.6.

 b. Mission Assignments to Air Targets. Mission assignments that
 require position data by a C[2] JU against air targets require a

 J12.0I/J12.0C1/J12.0C2 word sequence. Mission Type changes may be ordered

 using the J12.0I word singularly.

 c. Air Support Operations (ASO). This procedure spans all types of

 air-to-surface delivery. The term "surface" is inclusive of both ground and

 maritime surface environments. This procedure includes, but is not limited

 to, Air Interdiction (AI), Battlefield Air Interdiction (BAI), Tactical Air

 (TACAIR) Support for Maritime Operations (TASMO), Close Air Support (CAS),

 Precision Bombing, Laser Bombing, Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD),


-----

###### Aerial and Armed Reconnaissance, TACAIR Transport and Counter Air Attack

 missions.

 (1) Air Interdiction and Battlefield Air Interdiction. AI and

 BAI are related activities because targets for both are in the same general

 category. BAI targets have higher potential for near term effect on friendly

 forces. Real-time coordination of weapon systems conducting either mission

 may be accomplished via the interface by exchanging information between JUs

 to support, execute, and report results.

 (2) Tactical Air Support for Maritime Operations. Air

 operations in support of maritime forces may consist of aerial minelaying,

 surveillance and reconnaissance, and interdiction of enemy naval surface

 forces, port facilities, and shipping. Surface situational awareness

 information is primarily available through the monitoring of J3.0, J3.3,
 J3.5, and J3.7 messages. J12.6 message information from nonC[2] JUs may also be

 utilized. This mission is made up of certain aspects of other ASO activities

 and is unique largely by the character of its objectives.

 (3) Close Air Support. Tactical aircraft performing CAS,

 deliver ordnance against hostile forces that are in close proximity to

 friendly ground forces and requires coordination. ASO aircraft are given the

 location of a contact point from which to operate with an airborne or ground

 Forward Air Controller (FAC). The J12.4 message may be transmitted to

 provide the CAS aircraft the necessary information to contact the FAC. Final

 control to the target shall be provided by voice communication.

 (4) Precision Bombing. Precision bombing is performed by

 aircraft flying a precise delivery course under the direction of a remote,

 precision guidance/sensor system. The remote system may transmit vector

 information via the J12.1 message. Precise vectors and drop information may

 be transmitted in the J12.2 message.

 (5) Laser Bombing. Some tactical aircraft employ laser guided

 munitions. Targets for these munitions must be illuminated by a laser target

 designator. The J12.1 message may be used to vector the aircraft to the

 general location of the target/laser designator.


-----

###### (6) Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses. The purpose of this

 mission is to neutralize enemy air defenses in a specific area by physical
 attack or electronic warfare. C[2] JUs that have the capability to transmit the

 J14.0 message on the Control NPG may provide near real-time parametric EW
 data necessary to a nonC[2] JU for accomplishment of the mission. NonC[2] JUs on

 SEAD missions may have capability to receive the J14.0 data to update

 weapon/EA equipment employment parameters.

 (7) Aerial Reconnaissance. The purpose of this mission is to

 obtain intelligence information by airborne sensors or visual means. The

 J12.1 message may be used to provide course, speed, and altitude information

 to the aircrew, as required. The J12.3 message may be used to provide the

 platform with sequential multiple leg flight path information.

 (8) Armed Reconnaissance. This mission differs from Aerial

 Reconnaissance by intentions to deliver ordnance when targets of opportunity

 are located.

 (9) TACAIR Transport. The purpose of this mission is the

 carriage of passenger and cargo by means of airborne operations.

 (10) Counter Air Attack. The purpose of this mission is to

 ensure freedom of action for friendly forces and operations by inflicting

 damage on, or destroying enemy assets on the ground.

 d. Mission Assignment Discretes. The following specifies the use of

 Mission Assignment Discretes (MADs). Continuation words specified are

 requirements unless described as optional.

 (1) No Statement. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to

 value 0 is not used.

 (2) Refuel. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value 1

 is used to direct an aircraft to an airborne tanker or other refueling

 location. Its position is reported in either the J12.0C1 word, or in the

 J12.0C3 word with the Point Type, 1 field set to value 0, No Statement. The

 tanker or location shall be assigned a Track Number, reported by Objective

 TN. If the tanker is airborne or if Objective TN describes an airborne


-----

###### refueling point, if available, an altitude, course, speed, and specific type

 information shall be provided in the J12.0C2 word.

 (3) Orbit. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value 2

 is used to direct an aircraft to orbit at a specified track or point that

 currently is being reported in a J2 or J3 series message. The Objective TN

 specifies the track or point. Its position is reported in either the J12.0C1

 word, or in the J12.0C3 word with the Point Type, 1 field set to value 0, No

 Statement. If available, the Course and Speed of the Objective TN shall be

 included in the J12.0 message. If the Altitude is other than No Statement,

 the aircraft shall orbit at that altitude. If the Altitude is No Statement,

 the aircraft shall orbit at the nonzero altitude of the track or point, if

 any, or at pilot discretion.

 (4) Recall. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value 3

 is used to cancel any current mission, except Engage, Priority Kill, Attack,

 or Clear to Drop, and recall aircraft to a specified location to await

 further assignment. The recall location need not be assigned a Track Number,

 but if the location is a moving point, the Objective TN shall be the TN of

 the point, and it shall be assigned a Course and Speed. This MAD value is

 not used to direct aircraft to proceed to a specified location to land. The

 MAD field set to value 4, Return to Base, is used for that purpose.

 (5) Return to Base (RTB). The J12.0 message with the MAD field

 set to value 4 is used to direct aircraft to proceed to a specified base,

 home base, or other prearranged base to land. The specified base is the

 Objective TN. Its position is reported in either the J12.0C1 word, or in the

 J12.0C3 word with the Point Type, 1 field set to value 0, No Statement. 

 Other available amplifying information about the base is reported in the

 J12.0C2 word. If the Objective TN is No Statement, this MAD value is a

 general RTB order. In this case, aircraft are ordered to return to an

 unspecified base or other prearranged base, and only the J12.0I word is

 transmitted.

 (6) Engage. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value 5

 is used to order the destruction of an air target and provides target data. 

 The J12.0C1 word provides position information and the J12.0C2 word provides

 other necessary data.


-----

###### (7) Priority Kill. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to

 value 6 is used to order a high priority on the destruction of a specific air

 target. Target data are also provided in the J12.0C1 and J12.0C2 words.

 (8) Break Engagement. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set

 to value 7 is used to terminate a previous order to destroy an air target.

 (9) Investigate/Interrogate. The J12.0 message with the MAD

 field set to value 8 is used to order an aircraft to investigate or

 interrogate an air target and provide additional target information. The

 J12.0C1 and J12.0C2 words provide necessary target data.

 (10) Clear to Drop. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to

 value 9 is used to provide clearance for aircraft on TACAIR Transport

 missions to drop stores at a specified location. Objective TN is the target. 

 The J12.0C3 and, optionally, the J12.0C4 or J12.OC5 words provide necessary

 data. The J12.0C3 word with the Point Type, 1 field set to value 1, Target

 is used to designate precise drop area positional information. Additionally,

 the J12.2 message may be used by remote precision systems to accomplish air

 cargo delivery (see paragraph 4.12.1.2.3).

 (11) Cease/Do Not Drop. The J12.0 message with the MAD field

 set to value 10 is used to order aircraft on TACAIR transport missions to

 stop dropping stores or not to drop stores at a specified location.

 (12) Intervene. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to

 value 11 is used to order an aircraft to take action to divert a designated

 target aircraft from its intended flight path. The target is the Objective

 TN, and amplifying information about the target is provided in the J12.0C1

 and J12.0C2 words.

 (13) Divert. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value

 12 is used to direct an aircraft to cease its current mission and trajectory,

 except Engage, Priority Kill, Attack, or Clear to Drop, and proceed to a

 specified location. The location is specified by the Objective TN with

 amplifying information provided in the J12.0C1 or J12.0C3 words.


-----

###### (14) Air-to-Surface and Air-to-Air. The J12.0 message with the

 MAD field set to value 13 or 14 is used to order an aircraft to change its

 mission to air-to-surface or air-to-air, respectively.

 (15) Search and Rescue (SAR). The J12.0 message with the MAD

 field set to value 15 is used to assign an aircraft to SAR operations. The

 J12.0C1 word, or J12.0C3 word with Point Type, 1 field set to value 0, No

 Statement, is used to indicate the location of the search point.

 (16) Combat Air Patrol (CAP). The J12.0 message with the MAD

 field set to value 16 is used to order an aircraft to a CAP mission and

 provides data on the CAP station. The assigned CAP station is the Objective

 TN. The position of the CAP station, including altitude, shall be provided

 in the J12.0C1 and J12.0C2 words. For moving CAP stations, Course and Speed

 shall also be provided.

 (17) Precision Bombing. The J12.0 message with the MAD field

 set to value 17 is used to order an aircraft to a precision bombing mission

 and the target location and information is provided by the J12.0C3 and

 J12.0C4 words. The Point Type, 1 field shall be set to value 1, Target. If

 more precise location information is available than can be provided in the

 J12.0C3 word, the J12.0C5 word may be added. Either the Objective TN, or the

 Index Originator TN and Third Party IN in the J12.0C7 word identify the

 target. Third party targeting is not to be utilized if the precision bombing

 is part of a CAS mission.

 (18) Laser Designation. The J12.0 message with the MAD field

 set to value 18 is used to order an aircraft to a laser designation mission

 and provides target and illuminator code data. The Objective TN, if

 available, is the TN of the target, not the laser designator. The J12.0C3

 word is included to designate the location of the target with Point Type, 1

 field set value 1, Target. The J12.0C4 word may be utilized for target

 information. The J12.0C6 word provides the Laser Illuminator Code

 information to the aircraft. Either the Objective TN, or Index Originator TN

 and Third Party IN in the J12.0C7 word identify the target. If the position

 of the laser designator is known, a subsequent J12.0 message with the MAD

 field set to value 43, Related Mission Data, the Point Type, 1 field set to


-----

###### value 6, Laser Designator, and the Objective TN set to the TN of the laser

 designator may be transmitted.

 (19) Beacon Bombing. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set

 to value 19 is used to order an aircraft to a beacon bombing mission and

 provide necessary targeting data. The J12.0C3 word with Point Type, 1 field

 set to value 4, Beacon, depicts the location of the Objective TN, which is

 the beacon, not the target. The location of the target is provided by the

 setting of the J12.0C5 Target Range and Target Bearing fields, which report

 data relative to the beacon location. Additional data is provided in the

 J12.0C4 and J12.0C5 words, including Delta Elevation and Beacon Code.

 (20) Close Air Support (CAS). The J12.0 message with the MAD

 field set to value 20 is used to order an aircraft to a CAS mission and

 provides data needed for accomplishment of the mission. The Objective TN, if

 available, is the TN of the target. The J12.0C3 word is included to

 designate the location of the target. If the target is unknown, the

 Objective TN field and the J12.0C3 Latitude and Longitude fields shall be set

 to No Statement. The J12.0C4 word may be utilized for target information. A

 subsequent J12.0 message to specify the contact point and contact point

 location is transmitted in a J12.0I/J12.0C3/J12.0C6 word sequence with the

 MAD field set to value 43, Related Mission Data, the Point Type, 1 field set

 to value 5, Contact Point, and the Objective TN field set to the TN of the

 contact point.

 (21) Interdiction. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to

 value 21 is used to order an aircraft to an AI/BAI mission and provides

 target data. The J12.0C3 with the Point Type, 1 field set to value 1,

 Target, and the J12.0C4 word provide target location and information. If

 more precise location information is available than can be provided in the

 J12.0C3 word, the J12.0C5 word may be transmitted.

 (22) Aerial Reconnaissance. The J12.0 message with the MAD

 field set to value 22 is used to order an aircraft to an Aerial

 Reconnaissance mission and provides data on the target. The Objective TN is

 the TN of the reconnaissance point. The J12.0C1 word, or J12.0C3 word with

 the Point Type, 1 field set to value 8, Point; value 9, Center Point; or


-----

###### value 10, Initial Route Point, is included to designate the location of the

 reconnaissance point.

 (23) Escort. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value

 23 is used to order an aircraft to escort another aircraft or flight. The

 aircraft or flight to be escorted is the Objective TN. The current position

 of the Objective TN shall be reported in either the J12.0C1 word or J12.0C3

 word with the Point Type, 1 field set to value 0, No Statement. Available

 amplifying data shall be transmitted in the J12.0C2 word.

 (24) Shadow. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value

 24 is used to order an aircraft to maintain surveillance on a designated

 airborne target. The target is the Objective TN. Amplifying information

 about the target is reported in the J12.0C1 and J12.0C2 words.

 (25) Weapons Free and Weapons Tight. The J12.0 message with the

 MAD field set to value 25 or 26 is used to transmit a Weapons Free or Weapons
 Tight condition, respectively, to controlled nonC[2] JUs.

 (26) Salvo/Clear Aircraft. The J12.0 message with the MAD field

 set to value 27 is used to order aircraft to depart from or avoid a specified

 location. The location is specified as either a track or point reported in

 the J12.0C3 word with Point Type, 1 field set to value 0, No Statement, or

 J12.0C1 word for other than ASO missions. The direction the aircraft is to

 proceed away from the track or point cannot be specified with this MAD value. 

 If the direction is to be transmitted, a J12.1 Vector message with the Vector

 Discrete field set to value 12, Bug-out Heading, shall be transmitted.

 (27) Alert Conditions White, Yellow, and Red. The J12.0 message

 with the MAD field set to value 28, 29, or 30 is used to broadcast these

 warning signals which represent progressive conditions of real or threatened

 danger to friendly forces. The definitions of these terms are contained in

 operational doctrine. These MAD values shall only be addressed to the

 collective address 00177 (octal). These messages are used to broadcast

 general warning conditions with the Objective TN set to No Statement.

 (28) Cover. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value

 31 is used to order an aircraft to maintain a position relative to a


-----

###### designated air target, the Objective TN, from which a successful intercept

 can take effect if needed. The position and amplifying information reported

 in the J12.0C1 and J12.0C2 words relate to the target, not the relative

 position to be maintained. If specific relative position is to be

 maintained, then it is necessary to provide that information by other means,

 e.g., J12.1 Vector message or voice.

 (29) Visual Identification. The J12.0 message with the MAD
 field set to value 32 is used to order a nonC[2] JU to visually identify the

 target designated as the Objective TN. The position of the target shall be
 transmitted in the J12.0C1 word or, if the Addressee TN is an ASO nonC[2 ]JU, in

 a J12.0C3 word with the Point Type, 1 field set to value 1, Target. 

 Amplifying data shall be transmitted in the J12.0C2 word; if the Addressee TN
 is an ASO nonC[2] JU, the J12.0C5 and J12.0C7 words may be added if required.

 (30) Go To Voice. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to
 value 34 is used to order a nonC[2] JU to establish communications on the C[2]

 JU's JTIDS/MIDS Voice Channel as reported in PPLI messages or other
 prebriefed voice channel for C[2] JU control or additional information. Only

 the J12.0I word will be transmitted and the Objective TN will be set to No

 Statement. The Addressee TN may be set to a specific TN or the collective

 address, TN 00177 (octal).

 (31) High Interest Track Designation. The J12.0 message with

 the MAD field set to value 35 is used to send initial track data and order
 nonC[2] JUs to establish and maintain track data on selected high interest

 tracks designated as the Objective TN. The Addressee TN may be set to a
 specific TN or the collective address, TN 00177 (octal). NonC[2] JUs shall

 monitor the Surveillance NPG for track updates.

 The high interest track designation overrides the normal or currently
 selected host data and display filters designed into the nonC[2] JU. This
 capability shall be restricted to those special cases where the C[2] JU must be
 certain the nonC[2] JU accepts and displays the track data. Because the value

 is nonspecific as to the nature of the "High Interest", voice amplification
 is expected to follow the message. The C[2] JU shall transmit the J12.0 message

 with the MAD field set to value 36, Cancel High Interest Track Designation,


-----

###### as soon as the high interest nature of the track no longer exists. Reception

 of a J7.0 Drop Track message shall also cancel a high interest track.

 (32) Cancel High Interest Track Designation. The J12.0 message
 with the MAD field set to value 36 is used to order nonC[2] JUs to cancel the

 high interest track designation of the Objective TN. This cancellation
 permits nonC[2] JUs to purge the Objective TN from their databases. The

 Addressee TN may be set to a specific TN or the collective address, TN 00177

 (octal).

 (33) Sensor Target Reports On. The J12.0 message with the MAD
 field set to value 37 is used to order a nonC[2] JU to report on the Control NPG

 all air targets that it derives locally. This MAD value is also used to

 restore Addressee TN sensor target reporting after it has been ordered by a

 J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value 38 to cease reporting.

 (34) Sensor Target Reports Off. The J12.0 message with the MAD
 field set to value 38 is used to order a nonC[2] JU to cease Control NPG

 reporting of all air targets it derives locally. Receipt of this MAD value
 shall not inhibit nonC[2] JU engagement status reporting.

 (35) Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). The J12.0

 message with the MAD field set to value 39 is used to order an aircraft to a

 SEAD mission and provide initial target data. The J12.0C1, J12.0C3 with the

 Point Type, 1 field set to value 1, Target, or value 9, Center Point, J12.0C5

 and J12.0C7 words provide specific target information, and the J12.0C3 word

 contains basic location information. A J12.0C5 word may be included if

 precision location information is available, and the J14.0 message may be

 sent to provide EW parametric data, if appropriate.

 (36) Armed Reconnaissance. The J12.0 message with the MAD field

 set to value 40 is used to assign an ASO aircraft to an Armed Reconnaissance

 mission and provide target location information. The J12.0C3 with Point

 Type, 1 field set to value 8, Point, 9, Center Point, or 10, Initial Route

 Point, and optionally, the J12.0C5 and J12.0C7 words provide necessary data.

 (37) Attack. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value

 41 is used in two distinct ways:


-----

###### (a) As a final execution authority for a previously

 assigned MAD, i.e., 17, Precision Bombing; 18, Laser Designation; 19, Beacon

 Bombing; 21, Interdiction; 39, Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses; 40, Armed

 Reconnaissance; and 44, Counter Air Attack; or, for a prebriefed mission for

 which a MAD has not been previously issued. This is used only if final

 execution authority is required by the Rules of Engagement. The absence of

 detailed target data in the J12.0 MAD value 41, Attack message for the same

 Objective TN as a previous MAD shall not cause the purging of that data

 associated with the previous MAD.

 (b) For ASO missions other than CAS, to assign a new

 target, with immediate authority to complete the mission. In this use, the

 MAD is not preceded by another MAD value for the same Objective TN.

 (38) Cease Attack. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to

 value 42 is used to order an ASO aircraft to cease attacking the target

 specified by the Objective TN. This MAD value only cancels Attack MADs

 against specific targets, and not other mission assignments.

 (39) Related Mission Data. The J12.0 message with the MAD field

 set to value 43 provides an ASO aircraft with data on a point or laser

 designator which is related to a target. After transmitting an initial J12.0

 message with the MAD field set to value 9, 17, 18, 20, 21, 32, 39, 40, 41, or

 44, additional J12.0I/J12.0C1/J12.0C3/J12.0C6 or J12.0I/J12.0C3/J12.0C6 word

 sequences with the MAD field set to value 43 may be transmitted. The

 Objective TN in the J12.0I word or the IN in the J12.0C1 word is the TN or IN

 of the related point or laser designator, the Latitude and Longitude in the

 J12.0C3 word is the position of the Objective TN or IN, and the Point Type, 1

 field shall be set to a value other than 1, Target, or 15, Origin of Bearing. 

 The Related 3 TN or Related IN field shall be set to the TN or IN of the

 target which was transmitted in the previous J12.0 message.

 (40) Counter Air Attack. The J12.0 message with the MAD field

 set to value 44 is used to order an aircraft to a Counter Air Attack mission. 

 The J12.0C3 with Point Type, 1 field set to value 1, Target, and the J12.0C4

 word provide target location and information. The J12.0C5 word is optional.


-----

###### (41) Fighter Sweep. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to

 value 45 is used to order an aircraft on a Fighter Sweep mission. No target

 data is provided, as the mission is designed to seek out and destroy enemy

 targets of opportunity in the air.

 (42) Cease Fire. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to
 value 46 is used to order a nonC[2] JU SAM site not to fire against the target

 defined in the message. If firing has occurred, missiles in flight continue

 to intercept targets.

 (43) Hold Fire. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to
 value 47 is an emergency order used to order a nonC[2] JU SAM site not to fire

 against the target defined in the message. If firing has occurred, missiles

 in flight must be destroyed.

 (44) Cease Mission. The J12.0 message with the MAD field set to
 value 63 is used to order a nonC[2] JU to clear any previous order against a

 specific target except for Engage, Priority Kill, Clear to Drop, or Attack,

 MAD value 5, 6, 9, or 41. These are to be cleared by setting the MAD field

 to value 7, Break Engagement (to cancel an Engage or Priority Kill

 assignment), 10, Cease/Do Not Drop (to cancel a Clear to Drop assignment), or

 42, Cease Attack (to cancel an Attack assignment).

 e. Index Numbers in Mission Assignment Messages. C[2] JUs transmitting

 J12.0 messages shall always set the Index Number field to No Statement. 

 Units receiving a J12.0 with the Index Number set to No Statement shall not

 interpret the Origin of Index Number field.

 NonC[2] JUs transmitting J12.0 assignments may set the Index Number and Origin

 of Index Number fields to other than their default values.

 Assignments issued by nonC[2] JUs on nonC[2] JU sensor ASO targets are

 accomplished by transmitting the Index Number in the J12.0C1 word for

 engagements on targets reported by either the transmitting or receiving unit,

 or the Third Party IN in the J12.0C7 word for third party assignments. The

 following types of assignments may be issued:


-----

###### (1) A first party assignment occurs when the nonC[2] JU receiving

 the order has derived the target via onboard local sensors and is reporting

 the target. The Origin of Index Number field is set to value 1 and the Index

 Number field is set to the receiver's target Index Number. Target data,

 e.g., Latitude, Longitude, Course, Speed, shall not be included.

 (2) A second party assignment occurs when the nonC[2] JU

 transmitting the order has derived the target via onboard local sensors and

 is reporting the target. The Origin of Index Number field is set to value 0,

 and the Index Number field is set to the originator's target Index Number. 

 All available target data shall be included.

 (3) A third party assignment occurs when neither the nonC[2] JU
 transmitting the order, nor the addressed nonC[2] JU hold the target on local
 sensors. The target information is provided by a third party nonC[2] JU. In

 this case, the Origin of Index Number field is set to value 0, the Index

 Number field is set to No Statement, the J12.0C7 word Index Originator TN
 field is set to the third party nonC[2] JU, and the J12.0C7 word Third Party IN

 field is set to the third party's target Index Number. All available target

 data shall be included. Third party assignments will not be used for CAS.

 f. Situational Awareness. All nonC[2] JUs performing the ASO mission are

 required to monitor the Surveillance NPG for situational awareness. Also,
 nonC[2] JUs may monitor the NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPG to aid surface/ground

 situational awareness. As a minimum, the J3.0 Reference Point, J3.2 Air

 Track, J3.3 Surface (Maritime) Track, and J3.5 Land (Ground) Point/Track

 messages must be received and processed to provide surface and enemy and

 friendly force information, target descriptions, and locations. The J3.7 EW

 Product Information message and the J14.0 Parametric Information message may
 be received by nonC[2] JUs with SEAD mission capability. NonC[2] JUs may also
 utilize J12.6 Target Sorting message reports specifying nonC[2] JU derived
 target data. NonC[2] JUs conducting ASO shall receive lines and areas for

 situational awareness and update information primarily from the Surveillance
 NPG. NonC[2] JUs shall monitor J7.0 Track Management and J10.2 Engagement

 Status messages for amplification of the surveillance data.

 g. Ordering Mission Assignments. The initial J12.0 message is used by
 a controlling C[2] JU to order air-to-air, air-to-surface, and general mission


-----

###### assignments. Additionally, a nonC[2] JU conducting ASO missions may use J12.0

 messages for inter- and intra-flight orders as described in paragraph

 4.12.1.3.1.2n below. The R/C field on original orders shall be set as shown

 in table J12-2. The Objective TN field shall be set as follows:

 (1) C[2] JUs originating J12.0 messages for MAD values 1, 2, 5, 6,

 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42,

 43, 44, and 63 shall set the Objective TN field to the TN of the target or

 entity which is the object of the assignment.

 (2) C[2] JUs originating J12.0 messages for MAD values 3, 4, 9, 10,

 15, 20, 25, 26, and 27 shall either set the Objective TN field to No

 Statement where the assignment does not relate to a target/entity or shall

 set the Objective TN field as in paragraph 4.12.1.3.1g(1) above.

 (3) C[2] JUs originating J12.0 messages for MAD values 13, 14, 28,

 29, 30, 34, 37, 38, and 45 shall set the Objective TN field to No Statement.

 (4) To avoid TN accountability problems, the J12.0 message shall

 not be used to originate the Objective TN, i.e., the Objective TN shall have

 been reported on the Surveillance NPG.

 (5) NonC[2] JUs originating J12.0 messages shall set the Objective

 TN field to the TN of the target/entity which is the subject of the mission

 assignment or, where no Objective TN is available, shall set either the IN or

 Third Party IN field to the IN of the target/entity. Where no TN or IN is
 currently being reported for the target/entity, the nonC[2] JU shall allocate

 its next available IN for the J12.0 message.

 Mission assignments against targets defined by a line of bearing may be

 accomplished by transmitting a J12.0I/J12.0C1/J12.0C3/J12.0C5 word sequence. 

 The J12.0C7 word may be added if elevation angle data is available. The

 J12.0C3 word Point Type, 1 field shall be set to value 15, Origin of Bearing.

 h. Target Location. ASO missions are supported by location

 information broadcast in J3.0, J3.3, J3.5, and J3.7 Surveillance messages,

 J12.6 Target Sorting messages, and in a J12.0 Mission Assignment message. The
 J3 Surveillance information on a target is originated by any C[2] JU with R[2] for


-----

###### a point or track and is the primary source of situational awareness data for
 nonC[2] JUs. The J12.0C3 word with Point Type, 1 field set to value 1 and,

 optionally, the J12.0C1, J12.0C2, and J12.0C5 words include target data in a

 J12.0 message with the MAD field set to values 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 39,

 40, 41, or 44. The J12.0C5 word contains additional fields that may be used

 to expand the Latitude, Longitude, and Elevation fields to provide

 granularities of approximately 4 feet in all three dimensions. When the

 J12.0C5 word is included for purposes of increasing precision of location

 information, all other fields in that word will be set to No Statement. The

 J12.0C5 word shall not be transmitted if a J12.0C2 word indicates the target

 is moving, i.e., the Course and Speed fields are other than No Statement.

 i. Target Description. The J12.0C4 word Target Type field provides
 the capability for JUs to pass general target categories to nonC[2] JUs on ASO

 missions. More specific target descriptions may be provided by use of the

 J12.0C1 and J12.0C2 word combination with the Env/Cat and Specific Type

 fields set appropriately. Additionally, the J12.0C2 word may be used to

 provide Course, Speed, and Exercise Indicator information if deemed

 appropriate.

 j. Related Mission Information. Mission information related to the

 target is provided by setting the J12.0C3 word Point Type, 1 field to values

 other than 1 or 15 in a J12.0I/J12.0C3 word sequence. Multi-leg flight path

 information is provided in J12.3 messages. Up to 15 waypoints may be

 transmitted in separate J12.3 messages to update a preloaded route or as an

 original flight path assignment. A detailed explanation of J12.3 Flight Path

 message information is provided in the T/R rules. In some scenarios, J12.1

 messages may be sent to provide vectors in lieu of J12.3 Flight Path message

 information. The J12.0C4 word provides specific targeting data to include

 Target Type, Run In, and Egress Headings, Number and Type of Stores, and Time

 information. The J12.0C4 word Time Discrete, Hour, and Minute fields are
 used to assign Time on Target and Initial Point Time to a nonC[2] JU. If a JU

 desires to change an assigned Time on Target, a J12.0I/J12.0C4 message

 sequence shall be sent once with Time Discrete set to value 4, Changed Time

 on Target. Receiving platforms should then update the Time on Target for the

 mission. Subsequent J12.0C4 words will reflect the updated time by setting

 the Time Discrete field to value 1, Time on Target, and the Hour and Minute

 fields appropriately.


-----

###### k. Target Defenses. Target defense information is primarily available
 to nonC[2] JUs by monitoring the J3 series messages. Additionally, a

 controlling JU may provide information in a J12.0 message with the MAD field

 set to value 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 32, 39, 41, 43, or 44, by setting a value

 other than No Statement in the J12.0C4 Target Defenses field. Location of

 these defenses is provided by use of the Latitude and Longitude fields in a

 J12.0C3 word transmitted in a J12.0 message with the MAD field set to value

 43 and the Point Type, 1 field set to value 11, Target Defenses.

 l. Weather. Controlling C[2] JUs or nonC[2] JUs may broadcast weather in

 the target area using the J17.0 Weather Over Target message on the Control

 NPG in which the affected ASO aircraft is operating. The Objective TN is the

 target previously assigned in the J12.0 message. The Origin of Index Number
 and Index Number fields provide the capability for a nonC[2] JU to originate

 this message. Visibility, wind direction and strength, cloud cover and

 height, altimeter setting, and time of observation may be provided if data

 are available.

 m. NonC[2] JU Status. JUs may monitor the status of nonC[2] JU ASO

 missions by receiving J2.2 Air PPLI and J13.2 Air Platform and System Status

 messages. The J2.2 message provides the interface with real-time status

 through the Airborne Indicator, Exercise Indicator, Mission Commander

 Indicator, Flight Leader Indicator, and Mission Correlator fields. 

 Additionally, the Latitude and Longitude fields in the J2.2E0 word, and the

 Air Platform Activity and Mode III Code fields in the J2.2C1 word provide

 mission tracking information. The J13.2 message provides real-time data on

 ordnance load, fuel, operational status, and on board systems status. The

 J13.2I word Time Report Function, Minute, and Hour fields are used to provide

 real-time updates to the expected time on target. If the Mission Commander

 Indicator or the Flight Leader Indicator field in the J2.2I word is set to

 value 1, the Aircraft Operational Capability field in the J13.2I applies to

 the entire mission group or flight. Elements of a group or flight with a

 common mission may be identified by utilization of the J2.2 Mission

 Correlator field. Definition of specific values within the Mission

 Correlator field is determined by the operational commander (see paragraph

 4.10.1.1).


-----

###### n. NonC[2] JU to NonC[2] JU Communication. NonC[2] JUs on ASO missions shall
 have the capability to simultaneously operate on the Control and NonC[2] JU-to NonC[2] JU NPGs. They may have the capability to assign missions to other

 aircraft by transmitting J12.0 messages with the MAD field set to value 3, 4,
 9, 10, 13 through 22, 32, 34, 39 through 45, and 63 on the NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2]
 JU NPG. Protocols for transmission of the J12.0 message by a nonC[2] JU are

 described in paragraphs 4.12.1.3.1c, d, and e above.

 o. Reporting Mission Results. NonC[2] JUs shall have the capability to
 provide the controlling C[2] JU ASO mission results by utilizing the J12.6
 message. NonC[2] JUs shall transmit the J12.6 message with the SID field set to

 value 6, Track/Target Destroyed, 7, Disengaging, 8, Target Partially

 Destroyed, 11, Battle Damage Assessment Unknown, or 12, Recommend Reattack. 
 When the nonC[2] JU sets either the Mission Commander Indicator or Flight Leader

 Indicator field in the J2.2I word to value 1, the results may be reported for
 the entire mission group or flight. The C[2] JU will transmit the equivalent

 J10.2 WES message upon receipt of the J12.6 message ASO mission results from
 a nonC[2] JU.

 p. Processing J12.0 Data Fields when Objective TN Already Held. All
 applicable J12.0 data held by the C[2] JU shall be transmitted in the J12.0

 message as required, regardless of whether the Objective TN has been

 transmitted separately in a J3 Surveillance message.

 q. Multiple Mission Assignments. On receipt of a Mission Assignment a
 nonC[2] JU shall interpret the order as an immediate order. Mission Assignments

 are divided into two distinct categories; those that initiate or cancel the

 release of weapons against a target (Attack missions: e.g. Priority Kill or

 Engage), and those that do not initiate the release of weapons (non-Attack
 missions). The Attack missions take precedence over the latter. NonC[2] JUs

 may undertake multiple Attack Mission Assignments, but shall undertake only

 one non-Attack Mission Assignment at a time (and not simultaneously with an

 Attack Mission Assignment). Non-Attack Mission Assignments may be 'stacked'
 by a C[2] JU for transmission to a nonC[2] JU; a nonC[2] JU accepting a non-Attack

 Mission Assignment shall cancel any previous non-Attack Mission Assignment

 which it was undertaking. Prior to assigning a non-Attack Mission
 Assignment, a C[2] JU shall first cancel any current Attack Mission Assignment.


-----

###### r. Platform Activity Resulting From Mission Assignment. Selected
 Platform Activity values reported by a nonC[2] JU shall correspond to the
 mission functions and activities it performs. If a nonC[2] JU chooses to report

 a value other than the No Statement value in the Platform Activity field of

 the J2.2 PPLI message, it shall also implement value 127, Reset to No

 Statement. If a nonzero value, including the Reset to No Statement value,

 has been transmitted previously, either a new value other than zero or 127,
 Reset to No Statement, must be transmitted. A nonC[2] JU that implements

 nonzero Platform Activity field values shall set an applicable Platform

 Activity value in its PPLI message that corresponds to the J12.0 MAD when the

 controlled unit starts performing the assigned action.

 Table 4.12-1 depicts the applicable J12.0 MAD to J2.2 Platform Activity

 relationships. The table requirements are applicable only when read from
 left to right and present required implementation only for those nonC[2] JUs

 implementing nonzero values of the J2.2 Platform Activity field. For
 example, if a nonC[2] JU elects to implement for reception the J12.0 MAD value

 1, Refuel, it shall report in its J2.2 Platform Activity field value 29,
 Refueling/Tanking. If a nonC[2] JU elects to receive J12.0 MAD value 5, Engage,

 the reported Platform Activity can be any one of the listed values.

###### s. Status Information Discretes Resulting from Mission Assignment. 
 After transmitting a WILCO for a received J12.0 MAD, a nonC[2] JU shall report

 execution of the MAD by transmitting corresponding J12.6 SID values in

 addition to the requirements for transmitting J2.2 Platform Activity values.

 t. Reception of Mission Assignment Messages by Subordinate NonC[2] JUs. 
 In order to support operation of nonC[2] JUs as a flight of aircraft controlled
 as a single entity by the controlling C[2] JU or, for ASO missions, the nonC[2]

 Mission Commander, J12.0 messages addressed to the designated Flight Leader

 may be received and displayed by all flight members. In addition, responses

 to those messages may also be received and displayed. Only the addressed

 unit (Flight Leader) shall make the appropriate Receipt/Compliance responses.

 4.12.1.3.2 TARGET/TRACK CORRELATION PROCEDURES

 Controlling C[2] JUs shall perform correlation/decorrelation procedures on Index

 Numbers assigned to reported sensor targets and TNs assigned to Surveillance

 tracks. Correlated target/track data such as ID, etc., may be used to update
 databases and displays. C[2] JUs originating the J12.6 message must have

 previously assigned or associated a Surveillance TN with the target. Several
 nonC[2] JUs may hold sensor contact on the same target and already have assigned

 an Index Number to the target. All of these Index Numbers may be correlated
 to the target by the C[2] JU. The C[2] JU shall not concurrently correlate the
 same TN to more than one index number of a target from the same nonC[2] JU. All

 the above correlations shall be reported on the Control Network PG using the

 J12.5 message.

 Multiple TNs shall not be correlated to a single IN/Index Originator TN

 combination by using multiple J12.5 messages. If a new correlation message

 is received that is in conflict with a previous correlation message, the

 receiving JU shall break the previous correlation and accept the new

 correlation defined in the new correlation message.

 4.12.1.3.3 TARGET SORTING PROCEDURES

 Target reports are transmitted by nonC[2] JUs to indicate a sensor contact or

 engagement status at a given position. Target sorting consists of five

 related areas that are discussed separately for clarity. These areas are,


-----

###### Index Number Usage; Acquiring, Updating, and Canceling Targets; Engagements;

 Pointers; and Mark Points/Points of Interest.

 a. Index Number Usage. Index Numbers provide a means for nonC[2] JUs to

 distinguish individual sensor contacts. Index Numbers are an unmanaged block
 of 63 numbers, 1 through 77 octal, assigned by the originating nonC[2] JU. The

 Origin of Index Number field specifies whether the message originator or the
 message addressee assigned the Index Number. NonC[2] JUs are responsible for

 the management of their own Index Numbers and associated target data. New

 Index Numbers are established independent of the J12.6 SID field value. 

 Index Numbers are canceled by use of the J12.6 message with the SID field set

 to value 5, Cancel Sensor Target Report. Index Numbers are assigned in

 sequential order and not repeated until all numbers have been used.

 The J12.6 message may contain the Index Number, the Objective TN, neither, or

 both depending upon the data available.

 b. Acquiring, Updating, and Canceling Targets. NonC[2] JUs report sensor
 target data on the NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPG using the appropriate SID field

 value and word sequences specified in section 5 part 2, Tables J12-4.1
 through J12-4.6. NonC[2] JUs shall also have the capability to report selected
 sensor target data on the Control NPG. When nonC[2] JUs are transmitting their
 sensor target data on the Control NPG, the controlling C[2] JU shall monitor the
 nonC[2] JU originated sensor targets transmitted in J12.6 messages on the

 Control NPG to determine if an existing surveillance track correlates to a

 sensor target (see paragraph 4.12.1.3.2). If the sensor target meets the

 correlation criteria, a J12.5 message shall be transmitted on the same

 Control NPG as the J12.6 message was received. The Evaluated Identity and

 Evaluated Strength fields, if implemented, of the J12.5 message shall be set

 to the same values as locally held for the Identity and Strength of the

 surveillance track, and the ID/Strength Indicator field shall be set to value

 2. If the sensor target fails to meet the correlation criteria and the

 presence of a new track is indicated, the C²JU shall originate a J3 series

 message with a Track Quality as specified in Table 4.12-2, with the C²JU as

 Source TN on the Surveillance NPG, and a J12.5 message on the Control NPG. 

 The Evaluated Identity and Evaluated Strength fields, if implemented, of the

 J12.5 message shall be set to the same values as reported in the Identity and


-----

###### Strength fields of the received J12.6 message, and the ID/Strength Indicator

 shall be set to value 1.

 Table 4.12-2. TPQ to TQ Translation

 TPQ NOTES TQ

 0 No Statement 6

 1 < or = 4.4 Square Data Miles 8

 2 < or = 1.10 Square Data Miles 9

 3 < or = 0.0281 Square Data Miles 10

 When the J12.6 message is used to report the acquisition or updating of a

 radar target or when sensors other than radar or combined with radar

 determine there is a 95 percent probability that the target is within a 4.4

 square data mile area, the Latitude and Longitude fields in the J12.6I word

 shall be used to report the location of the Objective TN, i.e., target. If

 radar accuracy is known to be worse than 4.4 square data miles, the Target

 Position Quality field shall be set to No Statement.

 The J12.7 message is used to report a target derived exclusively by sources

 other than radar, i.e., alternate sensor(s), and there is not a 95 percent

 probability that the target is within a 4.4 square data mile area.

 NonC[2] JUs shall update all sensor targets on a periodic basis by transmitting

 the J12.6 and/or J12.7 messages as specified in the T/R rules.

 When a nonC[2] JU loses sensor contact it shall transmit a J12.6 message with
 the SID field set to value 5, Cancel Sensor Target Report. Since C[2] JUs use

 J12.6 sensor reports as an integrated sensor report, receipt of a Cancel

 Sensor Target Report shall be processed in the same manner as a lost radar

 report.

 c. Engagements. Engagements of sensor targets/surveillance tracks may
 be ordered by controlling C[2] JUs, independently initiated by a nonC[2] JU, or
 directed by another nonC[2] JU.

|TPQ|NOTES|TQ|
|---|---|---|
|0|No Statement|6|
|1|< or = 4.4 Square Data Miles|8|
|2|< or = 1.10 Square Data Miles|9|
|3|< or = 0.0281 Square Data Miles|10|


-----

###### (1) Engagements ordered by controlling C[2] JUs are explained in

 paragraph 4.12.1.3.1.

 (2) NonC[2] JUs may have the capability to order or direct

 engagements among themselves. ENV/CAT = 2, Air SID values 13, Investigate,

 14, Engage, or 15, Disengage, are used for this purpose. The J12.6 message

 shall contain either the Objective TN, an Index Number, or both if the data

 are available. If a correlation between Index Number and Track Number has

 been reported, the Objective TN must be included.

 There are four types of engagements that may be prosecuted through the use of

 a J12.6 message with the ENV/CAT = 2, Air SID field set to value 13, 14, or
 15. They are distinguished by whether nonC[2] JUs are sending the J12.6

 message, receiving the J12.6 message, providing radar illumination of the

 target, or using a surveillance report.

 (a) A first party engagement occurs when the nonC[2] JU

 receiving the order has derived the subject of the engagement via onboard

 local sensors and is reporting the target via the link. For a first party

 engagement, the Origin of Index Number field is set to value 1 and the Index

 Number field is set to the receiver's target index number. Target data,

 e.g., Latitude, Longitude, Course, Speed, etc., shall not be included.

 (b) A second party engagement occurs when the nonC[2] JU that

 is sending the order has derived the subject of the engagement via onboard

 local sensors and is reporting the target via the link. For a second party

 engagement, the Origin of Index Number field is set to value 0, and the Index

 Number field is set to the sender's target index number. All available

 target data shall be included.

 (c) A third party engagement occurs when neither the nonC[2]
 JU sending the order, nor the nonC[2] JU receiving the order holds the target on

 local sensors. The subject of the engagement is provided on the link by a
 third nonC[2] JU. For a third party engagement, the Origin of Index Number

 field is set to value 0, the Index Number field is set to No Statement, the

 Index Originator TN field is set to the TN of the illuminator; and the Third

 Party Index Number field is set to the illuminator's target index number. 

 All available target data shall be included.


-----

###### (d) A surveillance engagement occurs when no nonC[2] JU holds

 the surveillance track on local sensors. The subject of the engagement is

 provided by monitoring the Surveillance NPG. For a surveillance engagement

 all index number and index number related fields are set to No Statement. 

 The surveillance TN and all other target data shall be included.

 (3) NonC[2] JUs report engagements using the J12.6 message

 containing either the Objective TN, an Index Number, or both if the data are

 available. If a correlation between Index Number and TN has been reported

 the Objective TN must be included. The SID field values used to report the

 engagement are 1, Engaging or Attacking, 2, Investigating, 3, Missile In

 Flight/Weapon Released, 6, Track/Target Destroyed, or 7, Disengaging. J12.6

 messages reporting engagements are transmitted on the Control NPG. As long

 as the engagement status remains unchanged, the same SID field value shall be

 used for updates at the rate specified in section 5, part 2, Tables J12-4.1

 through J12-4.6. The SID field value shall change only when the actual

 engagement status changes.

 (4) NonC[2] JUs operating on Needline PGs that have the capability

 to report engagements against air targets may use the J12.6C1 WES field, in

 addition to SID field. When implemented, the WES values must be in accordance

 with SID field values used to report the engagement as specified in the
 following table. The table does not apply to the Control or nonC[2] JU-to-nonC[2]

 JU NPGs.

 Table 4.12-3. J12.6 Engagement Status Values Relationships

|Status Information Discrete Value|Weapon Engagement Status|
|---|---|
|0 - No Statement|0 - No Statement|
|1 - Engaging|4 - Firing/Missile in Flight/Engaging to Destroy|
|2 - Investigating|2 - Weapon Assigned 3 - Tracking/Locked on/Ready to Fire 11 - Investigating/Interrogating|
|3 - Missile in Flight/Weapon Released|4 - Firing/Missile in Flight/Engaging to Destroy|
|6 - Track/Target Destroyed|5 - Effective/Target Destroyed/Grand Slam|
|7 - Disengaging|8 - Engagement Broken|
|8 - Target Partially Destroyed|6 - Partially Effective|
|11 – Not effective|7 – Not Effective|
|12 – Covering|14 – Covering|


-----

###### (5) When operating in a flight or group only one flight member,

 preferably the flight leader, shall report engagement status on the Control

 NPG. (A flight or group is a unit made up of aircraft that will execute

 orders as a single entity.) The member reporting shall do so for the entire

 flight, e.g., if one member of the flight is still engaging then the entire

 flight is engaging; also, if one member of the flight has broken the

 engagement but the others have not, a Disengaging shall not be sent until the

 entire flight has broken the engagement. This procedure applies to all SID

 field values.

 (6) A "Heads Up" can be reported using the J12.6 message with

 the ENV/CAT = 2 Air SID field set to value 9, Heads Up. This message may be
 used between nonC[2] JUs or from a nonC[2] JU to a C[2] JU and must include either

 the Objective TN, an Index Number, or both, in accordance with paragraphs (2)

 and (3) above.

 d. Pointers. The J12.6 message with the Pointer field set to value 1

 provides the capability to designate a geographic position or track/target on

 a JU's display. When the Pointer field is set, voice communications usually

 specify why the pointer was transmitted. The method of removing pointers

 from the receiving system's display is a system option. This use of the

 J12.6 Pointer message has two applications.

 (1) C[2] JU to NonC[2] JU. When a C[2] JU desires to designate a
 geographic position to a nonC[2] JU, a J12.6 message is used on the Control NPG. 
 Also, if the C[2] JU desires to call the attention of a nonC[2] JU to a track, a

 J12.6 Pointer message is used. In this case, the track/target data shall

 reflect the actual data of the track/target but should not be processed if
 the nonC[2] JU already holds the track/target data to preclude conflicting data. 

 Either the Objective TN or the Index Number must be provided. When used to

 designate a track/target, the SID field set to value 0 shall be used, but

 shall not override a previously received nonzero SID field value.

 (2) NonC[2] JU to NonC[2] JU/C[2] JU. NonC[2] JUs shall use the J12.6

 message to call the attention of another JU to a geographic position or
 track/target. When it is used to designate a track/target position, a nonC[2]
 JU shall use the J12.6 message as described in paragraph (1). When a nonC[2] JU

 wishes to call the attention of a JU to a geographic position, the J12.6


-----

###### message is used with the SID field set to value 0 and the Index Number and

 Objective TN fields set to No Statement.

 e. Mark Points/Points of Interest. Mark Points may be exchanged among
 nonC[2] JUs or sent to C[2] JUs on the Control NPG.

 (1) Mark Points are used between nonC[2] JUs operating in an ASO

 environment to exchange tactically significant data points used to depict

 targets of opportunity or specific points for tactical coordination.

 (2) When sent to a C[2] JU on the Control NPG, Mark Points normally

 depict a Target of Opportunity or specific attack location for a large

 target, e.g., the front of a column of tanks or specific location on an
 airfield. The Controlling C[2] JU shall decide on an individual manual basis if

 the Mark Point should be sent on surveillance as a J3.0 Reference Point, J3.3

 Surface (Maritime) Track, J3.5 Land (Ground) Track/Point message, or not at

 all.

 4.12.1.3.4 NONC[2] JU-TO-NONC[2] JU NPG PROCEDURES

 As discussed in paragraph 4.2.3.10.13, the NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPG provides
 the capability for nonC[2] JUs to exchange data. The following subparagraphs

 describe the uses and capabilities of this NPG.

 a. NonC[2] JUs shall have the capability to report and update targets,

 report engagement status and results, and may assign targets/order
 engagements to other nonC[2] JUs on the same NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPG. Message

 protocols and sequences are described in paragraphs 4.12.1.2.7 and

 4.12.1.2.8.

 b. J12.6 and J12.7 messages sent on a NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPG shall be

 updated at a higher data rate than that specified for the Control NPG (see

 section 5, part 2, Tables J12-4.1 through J12-4.6 and J12.7 T/R rules). This
 is necessary to provide the greater data accuracy possible with many nonC[2] JU

 onboard sensors.

 c. Assigning of targets or ordering of engagements may be accomplished
 by any nonC[2] JU that has operational authority to do so. No protocols have


-----

###### been established to limit capabilities of any participating nonC[2] JU based on

 other Link 16 information provided on the interface.

 d. NonC[2] JUs shall have the capability of operating concurrently on the
 Control and NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPGs. This enables a flight leader to report
 engagement status to the controlling C[2] JU while communicating with the flight

 during the conduct of the mission (see paragraph 4.12.1.3.3c(4)). It also
 allows all addressed nonC[2] JU flight members to receive controlling C[2] JU

 mission assignments, vectors, control change orders, and pointers. All
 participating nonC[2] JUs shall receive nonaddressed Control NPG communication,

 such as correlations and condition orders. The possibility of conflicting
 orders to any nonC[2] JU that this procedure establishes may be averted through

 application of operational doctrine.

 e. C[2] JUs may receive but not transmit on a NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPG. A
 C[2] JU may monitor a NonC[2] JU-to-NonC[2] JU NPG in lieu of the Control NPG for the

 purpose of receiving target reports and engagement status to fulfill

 Controlling Unit reporting responsibilities delineated in paragraph 4.12.1.

 4.12.1.3.5 VECTOR PROCEDURES

 The J12.1 message may be used in virtually any phase of flight. Vector

 information is either advisory in nature or a command. When the R/C field is

 set to value 0, the J12.1 message is a command. When the R/C field is set to

 value 5, the J12.1 message is advisory, but a Machine Receipt is required. 

 Absence of a J12.1E0 word indicates an advisory message and no R/C is

 required. Whenever the J12.1 message with the R/C field set to value 0 is

 used in conjunction with a J12.0 message, a J12.0 WILCO message must be

 received prior to transmitting the J12.1 message (see section 5, part 1,

 Table J12-3.).

 4.12.1.3.6 RENDEZVOUS PROCEDURES

 Tactical situations may require vectoring of nonC[2] JUs to a point in space
 used for rendezvousing to effect such actions as a join-up of nonC[2] JUs,
 placement of nonC[2] JUs on CAP stations, or assemblage of nonC[2] JUs for
 refueling. The J12.0I word is transmitted by the controlling C[2] JU to the
 nonC[2] JU to identify the rendezvous objective or mission and is followed by


-----

###### the J12.0C1 word and the J12.0C2 or J12.0C3 word that provide the rendezvous

 point and amplifying information. The J12.0I word contains R/C information. 

 If the J12.1 message with the R/C field set to value 0 is required, it shall

 be transmitted after receipt of the J12.0 WILCO message. In the event that

 course, altitude, or speed are required in the execution of a rendezvous, the

 J12.1I word with the Vector Discrete field is set to value 9, 10, or 11 and

 the J12.1E0 word is added to require R/C. The J10.6 Pairing message is
 transmitted by the controlling C[2] JU to other controlling C[2] JUs to indicate
 the pairing between the nonC[2] JU under control and the rendezvous objective. 
 Rendezvous pairings shall be terminated by controlling C[2] JUs in accordance

 with paragraph 4.11.3.3.3.

 4.12.1.3.7 CONTROL INITIATION/CHANGE PROCEDURES

 The J12.4 Controlling Unit Change message is used to initiate control of a
 nonC[2] JU not under control or whose controlling unit has become inactive, to
 effect the handover of control from a C[2] JU to another controlling unit, and
 to terminate control of a nonC[2] JU. The protocols for these three distinctly

 different uses are specified as follows:

 a. Initiation of Control. Control may be initiated either by a C[2] JU
 or by a nonC[2] JU. These two cases are described separately.

 (1) C[2] JU Initiation. The C[2] JU initiation of control is

 described in the following paragraphs.

 (a) If a C[2] JU implements the option to initiate control of
 a nonC[2] JU not currently under control, the C[2] JU shall transmit a

 J12.4I/J12.4E0 word sequence with the Control Change Indicator (CCI) field
 set to value 0, Control Change Order, to the nonC[2] JU with the R/C field set

 to value 0. The New Control Agency TN field shall be set to the Source TN of
 the initiating C[2] JU. The Control Channel field shall be set to the JTIDS

 Control Channel Number of the Control NPG on which control is desired. The

 Voice Frequency/Channel and Voice Frequency/Channel Indicator fields may be

 set to specify the UHF Frequency or Channel Group A or B to be used for

 Primary or Alternate voice communications. The voice call sign of the
 initiating C[2] JU may also be provided in the New Control Agency Voice Call

 Sign field. The Mode III Code field may be set to a Mode III code that the


-----

###### nonC[2] JU is requested to use. The Squawk Flash Indicator may be set to
 request the nonC[2] JU to squawk flash. The Radio Type and Secure Radio

 Indicator fields may also be used to specify information about the UHF

 Frequency, if reported. The Link 4A Frequency field shall be set to No

 Statement.

 (b) The nonC[2] JU addressed in the J12.4 message with the

 CCI field set to value 0 shall respond with a J12.4 message with the R/C
 field set to value 2, Machine Receipt. The nonC[2] JU shall also respond with a
 J12.4 message with an appropriate R/C field value. The C[2] JU shall respond

 with a J12.4 message with the R/C field set to value 2, Machine Receipt. If
 the nonC[2] JU response was WILCO, the nonC[2] JU shall transmit a J12.4I word

 with R/C set to value 0 and the CCI field set to value 1, Control Request, to
 the receiving C[2] JU on the Control Channel specified in the original J12.4

 message with the CCI field set to value 0. The New Control Agency TN,

 Control Channel, Radio Type, and Secure Radio Indicator fields shall be set

 to No Statement.

 (c) The C[2] JU addressed in the J12.4 message with the CCI

 field set to value 1 shall respond with a J12.4 message with the R/C field

 set to value 2, Machine Receipt, and then a J12.4 message with the R/C field
 set to value 4, HAVCO. The nonC[2] JU shall transmit a J12.4 message with the

 R/C field set to value 2, Machine Receipt. This completes the initiation of

 control.

 (d) In the above sequence, if the C[2] JU implements the J0.3
 message and has Control NPG time slots awaiting assignment to the nonC[2] JU,
 the J0.3 message shall be transmitted by the C[2] JU after the Machine Receipt

 for the original J12.4 message with the CCI field set to value 1 but before

 the HAVCO. The HAVCO shall not be transmitted until a Machine Receipt is

 received for the J0.3 message. If a CANTPRO is received for the J0.3
 message, an operator in the C[2] JU shall be alerted in order to provide an

 opportunity to CANTCO the J12.4 message with the CCI field set to value 1.

 (2) NonC[2] JU Initiation. Procedures for nonC[2] JU initiation of
 control differ depending on whether or not the nonC[2] JU knows the TN of the
 desired controlling C[2] JU, as described below.


-----

###### (a) A nonC[2] JU that is not currently under control and
 knows the TN of the desired controlling C[2] JU on a control channel shall
 initiate a request to the C[2] JU for control by transmitting a J12.4 message

 with the R/C field set to value 0 and the CCI field set to value 1, Control
 Request. The Addressee TN shall be set to the TN of the C[2] JU. The New

 Control Agency TN, Control Channel, Radio Type, and Secure Radio Indicator
 fields shall be set to No Statement. The requested C[2] JU shall respond with a

 J12.4 message with the R/C field set to value 2, Machine Receipt. The
 requested C[2] JU shall assume control by transmitting a J12.4 message with the

 R/C field set to value 3, WILCO, or 4, HAVCO, or refuse control by

 transmitting a J12.4 message with the R/C field set to value 6, CANTCO, or 7,
 CANTPRO, to the requesting nonC[2] JU. The nonC[2] JU shall transmit a J12.4
 message with the R/C field set to value 2, Machine Receipt. If the C[2] JU

 response was WILCO or HAVCO, this completes the initiation of control. If
 the C[2] JU has other J12.4 data to provide to the nonC[2] JU, it must reinitiate

 control after control has been initially assumed, i.e., after the WILCO or

 HAVCO message has been transmitted and receipted. The protocols for
 reinitiation in this case are identical to those for C[2] JU initiation.

 (b) In the above sequence, if the C[2] JU implements the J0.3
 message and has Control NPG time slots awaiting assignment to the nonC[2] JU,
 the J0.3 message shall be transmitted by the C[2] JU after the Machine Receipt

 for the original J12.4 message with the CCI field set to value 1 but before

 the WILCO or HAVCO. The WILCO or HAVCO shall not be transmitted until a

 Machine Receipt is received for the J0.3 message. If a CANTPRO is received
 for the J0.3 message, an operator in the C[2] JU shall be alerted in order to

 provide an opportunity to CANTCO the J12.4 message with the CCI field set to

 value 1.

 (c) When a nonC[2] JU not currently under control does not
 know the TN of the controlling C[2] JU on a desired control channel, it shall

 initiate a request for control by transmitting a J12.4I word with the R/C

 field set to value 1 and the CCI field set to value 1. The Addressee TN

 shall be set to the collective addressee, 00177 (octal). The New Control

 Agency TN, Control Channel, Radio Type, and Secure Radio Indicator fields

 shall be set to No Statement. This J12.4 message shall be transmitted

 periodically at an RRN of 6 (12 seconds, 8-20 second interval) until

 transmission is terminated by operator action or a J12.4 message with the CCI


-----

###### field set to value 0, Control Change Order, is received. Any C[2] JU receiving

 this J12.4 message with the CCI field set to value 1, Control Request, shall

 display the request to an operator. If the operator accepts the request, the
 C[2] JU shall initiate control of the requesting nonC[2] JU as specified for C[2] JU

 initiation.

 b. Handover of Control. The J12.4 message is also used to effect
 handover of nonC[2] JU control in conjunction with the following digital

 handover procedures under handover of control.

 (1) A C[2] JU that has requested another IU to take control in the

 J10.3 message and has received a WILCO for the J10.3 message shall transmit a

 J12.4I/J12.4E0 word sequence with the R/C field set to value 0 and the CCI
 field set to value 0 to the nonC[2] JU which was the Reference TN in the J10.3

 message. The New Control Agency TN field shall be set to the TN of the

 controlling unit receiving the handover. The New Control Agency Voice Call

 Sign shall be set to the voice call sign of the receiving unit, if held. The

 other J12.4 message fields shall be set to the same values as received in the

 J10.3C1 word of the WILCO message received in response to the original J10.3

 message request.

 (2) The nonC[2] JU addressed in the J12.4 message with the CCI

 field set to value 0 shall respond with a J12.4 message with the R/C field

 set to value 2, Machine Receipt. It shall also respond with a J12.4 message
 with an appropriate R/C. The C[2] JU shall respond with a J12.4 message with
 the R/C field set to value 2, Machine Receipt. If the response to the C[2] JU
 is WILCO, the nonC[2] JU shall transmit a J12.4I word three times at an RRN of 6

 (12 seconds, 8-20 second interval) with the R/C field set to value 0 and the
 CCI field set to value 1 to the receiving C[2] JU on the Control Channel

 specified in the original J12.4 message with the CCI field set to value 0. 

 Receipt of a response message shall cause the periodic transmission to cease. 

 The New Control Agency TN, Control Channel, Radio Type, and Secure Radio
 Indicator fields shall be set to No Statement. If the nonC[2] JU response is
 CANTCO or CANTPRO, the C[2] JU shall retain control and transmit a J10.3 Cancel
 Handover message to the receiving C[2] JU.

 (3) The C[2] JU addressed in the J12.4 with the CCI field set to

 value 1 shall respond with a J12.4 message with the R/C field set to value 2,


-----

###### Machine Receipt, and a J12.4 message with the R/C field set to value 4,
 HAVCO. The nonC[2] JU shall transmit a J12.4 message with the R/C field set to

 value 2, Machine Receipt. This completes the handover of control. The
 former controlling C[2] JU shall not transmit a J12.4 message with the CCI field

 set to value 2, Terminate Control.

 (4) In the above sequence, if the C[2] JU implements the J0.3
 message and has Control NPG time slots awaiting assignment to the nonC[2] JU,
 the J0.3 message shall be transmitted by the C[2] JU after the Machine Receipt

 for the original J12.4 message with the CCI field set to value 1 but before

 the HAVCO. The HAVCO shall not be transmitted until a Machine Receipt is

 received for the J0.3 message. If a CANTPRO is received for the J0.3
 message, an operator in the C[2] JU shall be alerted to provide an opportunity

 to CANTCO the J12.4 message with the CCI field set to value 1.

 (5) A C[2] JU may direct a nonC[2] JU to change control to a unit

 that is not an IU by transmitting a J12.4I/J12.4E0 message with the CCI field

 set to value 0 and the R/C field set to value 0. Either the New Control

 Agency TN or New Control Agency Voice Call Sign must be set to other than No

 Statement. The Control Channel field shall be set to No Statement. Other

 J12.4E0 fields shall be set to other than No Statement, if data are
 available. The nonC[2] JU will respond with a J12.4 message with the R/C field

 set to value 2, Machine Receipt, followed by a J12.4 message with the
 appropriate R/C. If the controlling C[2] JU receives a J12.4 message with the

 R/C field set to value 3, WILCO, it shall report terminating control by

 transmitting a J10.5 message with the Controlling Unit Status field set to
 value 0. The nonC[2] JU will then contact the new controlling agency by voice

 as indicated in the original J12.4I/J12.4E0 message or as prebriefed. If the
 controlling C[2] JU receives a J12.4 message with the R/C field set to value 6,
 CANTCO, the controlling C[2] JU maintains control and cancels the handover. If
 the controlling C[2] JU receives a J12.4 message with the R/C field set to value

 7, CANTPRO, the operator shall be alerted so that the operator may attempt

 the change of control by other means, e.g., voice.

 If control of a paired or engaged nonC[2] JU is passed to a nonIU, the
 controlling C[2] JU shall send a J10.5 message indicating terminating control,

 and shall cease transmitting J10.6 pairings and J10.2 engagements.


-----

###### c. Termination of Control. When a controlling C[2] JU terminates control
 of a controlled unit, then the C[2] JU shall comply with paragraph 4.11.3.2.3. 
 The C[2] JU shall monitor for a response and if a CANTCO, CANTPRO, or No Machine

 Receipt is received, the operator shall be alerted.

 4.12.1.3.8 REPORTING STATUS PROCEDURES

 Air, surface (maritime), subsurface (maritime) and land (ground) platforms

 use Link 16 to pass their status. The reporting status structure is

 analogous to reporting PPLI and surveillance data; therefore, the messages

 are laid out according to environment/category. Procedures for reporting the

 status of platforms and systems are described in paragraph 4.11.3.3.2.

 4.12.1.3.9 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

 ATC is the control of aircraft for nontactical purposes. Services to

 aircraft include aid in arrival/departure and enroute traffic control. The

 J12.1 message is the basic tool used to provide ATC. When conducting ATC,
 the controlling C[2] JU uses the J12.1I word to provide the aircraft with

 course, altitude, and speed information; and the J12.1E0 word is used to

 provide R/C information. The J12.2I word is used to guide aircraft to

 approach and landing. The J12.3I and J12.3E0 words are used by air traffic

 controllers to provide aircraft with specific flight paths and altitudes. 

 The J12.4I/J12.4E0 words provide the aircraft with the communications and

 IFF/SIF information necessary for local handovers.

 4.12.1.3.10 AIR INTERCEPT CONTROL

 AIC is the process of providing vector information to an aircraft to position

 it in the vicinity of another air track. The positioning data provided

 depends on the type of intercept to be accomplished and is indicated by the

 value set in the Vector Discrete field.

 To initiate an intercept, the J12.0I word is transmitted to order the

 aircraft to engage or investigate the target. The J12.0I word is followed by

 the J12.0C1 and J12.0C2 words to provide amplifying target data.


-----

###### 4.12.1.3.11 ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE AIR CONTROL

 ASW air control is the direction of aircraft capable of detecting and/or

 destroying submarines. Aircraft are provided with search areas, target

 locations, vectors for target localization and weapon release. Assignments

 are made using the J12.0I word, with the 12.0C3 word providing ASW related

 search areas and points as required. Target position may be determined by

 using the Objective TN and the J3 Surveillance messages. Vector information

 may be provided in the J12.1 message.

 4.12.1.3.12 SEARCH AND RESCUE

 The purpose of this mission is to assign aircraft to SAR operations. The

 J12.0C1 word or the J12.0C3 word, as appropriate for the aircraft, is used to

 indicate the location of the search point. Search patterns may be specified

 by using the J12.3 message, or search legs by using individual J12.1

 messages.

 4.12.1.3.13 REMOTELY PILOTED VEHICLE/MISSILE CONTROL

 There are two distinct classes of control for these systems. One is RPV

 where the JU equipped RPV/missile is in positive sensor or visual contact
 with the controlling C[2] JU. The operator inputs at the C[2] JU directly affect

 the airframe's control surfaces for course, speed, and altitude changes in

 real time. The other class is missile control where the JU equipped

 RPV/missile may or may not be in positive sensor contact with the controlling
 C[2] JU and the operator's inputs are flight profile and target position data. 

 In this case, the missile executes the profile sequentially to reach the

 assigned target.

 In the RPV class of control the real-time changes to a RPV/missile's control

 surfaces are transmitted in the J12.2 message.

 The missile class of control includes the ability to specify targets that are

 not in sensor contact with the launching unit, such as in over-the-horizon

 targeting. The J12.3 message fully supports this procedure by supplying the

 sequential flight path and altitude to the target's position.


-----

###### Transfer control of RPV and missiles is TBD.

 4.12.1.3.14 AUTOMATIC CARRIER LANDING SYSTEM/AUTOMATIC LANDING SYSTEM

 PRECISION DIRECTION

 The ACLS/Automatic Landing System (ALS) procedure is used for precise

 aircraft control during the final phases of landing. This direction may

 either be to cockpit displays and/or coupled to the autopilot for hands-off

 control to touchdown. The J12.1I word is used for general guidance in flight

 phases prior to initiation of the precision phase of the recovery. The J12.2

 message then provides the precise course guidance required.

 4.12.1.3.15 EXERCISE INDICATOR IN CONTROL MESSAGES

 The Exercise Indicator and the Identity Amplifying Descriptor fields in the

 J12.0 and J12.6 message always refer to the track or sensor target. The

 Specific Type must also be considered artificial and for exercise purposes. 

 No other data in the messages shall be artificial. (See paragraph 4.4.2.1.1

 for the relationship between the Exercise Indicator, Identity, and Identity

 Amplifying Descriptor fields.)

 4.12.1.4 CONDITIONAL RADIO SILENCE AIR CONTROL PROCEDURES

 All JUs have the capability to select the Conditional Radio Silence mode of

 terminal operation. This mode is described in subsection 3.3, JTIDS/MIDS

 technical characteristics. JUs will have the capability to receive Link 16
 data while the terminal is set to Conditional Radio Silence. Controlling C[2]

 JUs not in conditional radio silence will have the capability to transmit J
 Series messages to JUs operating in the Conditional Radio Silence mode. The
 C[2] JU system may be automated to provide modified processing of J12 series

 messages, such as assumed responses, assigning modified R/C values, or

 developing J10.2 Engagement Status messages. If this automation is

 implemented, it shall depend upon receipt of a J2.2 message with the Network
 Participation Status Indicator field set to value 3 from a controlled nonC[2]
 JU. This will identify that the nonC[2] JU is in Conditional Radio Silence
 mode. Procedures for controlling nonC[2] JUs in the Conditional Radio Silence

 mode are described below.


-----

###### a. Mission Assignments. The J12.0 Mission Assignment messages are

 transmitted in accordance with paragraph 4.12.1.3.1 and the J12.0

 transmit/receive rules. However, since a conditional radio silence JU will
 not respond with either a machine receipt or an operator response, the C[2] JU

 must accommodate for the lack of a response. This can be accomplished either

 by system design or operational procedures. Any new J12.0 message

 transmitted will negate any previous J12.0 message.

 b. Vectoring. All J12.1 Vector messages addressed to a Conditional
 Radio Silence nonC[2] JU shall be transmitted with the R/C field set to value 1,

 Original Order, so that no response is required.

 c. Engagement Status. While controlling a JU operating in the
 Conditional Radio Silence mode, it is assumed that the nonC[2] JU will comply

 with J12.0 mission assignments, unless operator observation indicates

 otherwise, even though a WILCO response is not received. Since it is assumed
 that the nonC[2] JU will comply with the last J12.0 message transmitted, a J10.2

 Engagement Status message corresponding to the last J12.0 message transmitted

 (see Tables 4.11-3 and 4.11-4) shall be transmitted either automatically or

 by operator action. T/R rules for the J10.2 message are the same regardless

 of the conditional radio silence status.

 4.12.1.5 WEATHER OVER TARGET MESSAGE

 The J17.0 Weather Over Target message is used to inform or update previously

 reported tactically significant weather data that exists in a target area.
