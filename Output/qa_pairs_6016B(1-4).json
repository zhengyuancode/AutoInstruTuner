Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD) is concerned with the active defense against the TBM portion of the total TM threat. TBMD capable systems may be comprised of lower tier and upper tier missile defenses which provide critical asset and area defense. The TBMD systems may operate independently or as an integrated, multi-tiered system, or in geographically distributed enclaves. Lower tier systems will provide TBMD for designated critical assets, e.g., airfields, theater C[2] nodes, or seats of government as well as protecting theater targets, naval and maneuver forces, supply points, or critical weapon delivery systems."
